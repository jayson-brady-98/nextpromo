ryobi,"Gingerbread Dollhouse Reveal! With @ryobiau üõ†Ô∏è This renovation has been 12 months in the making and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve finally reached the finish line! üèÅ Excuse me while I park my delirious self on the couch while the kids pull it apart. Ha! But seriously, thank you so much for following along. It‚Äôs brought me so much joy and satisfaction!

If you‚Äôre new to this project, it all started when I decided to renovate an old dollhouse into a Gingerbread House for my kids this Christmas. After months of searching high and low, I found the perfect secondhand dollhouse at a charity shop for $50. From there I spiralled into a woman obsessed, but also armed with the best power tools in the biz, with wallpaper, popsicle stick shingles and timber-stained floorboards, making almost all the miniature furniture and decor
from scratch by reusing as many materials as humanly possible, as well as all the teeny tiny Christmas decorations and decorating the outside
with icing.

And the fact that I got this done two weeks before Christmas surely gives me some brownie points with my kids. I might look and feel deranged, have given myself countless blisters and lost a lot of sleep, but at least my kids love it! For a detailed room-by-room walkthrough, head over to my YT where I share the final episode in
this epic Gingerbread Dollhouse Renovation series!

The RYOBI 18V ONE+ range is available from Bunnings Warehouse In-store, online or through Click & Collect.

We‚Äôre starting the year right with a clean home and getting into all those areas that are often forgotten about. Think mattresses, bed heads, under-the-couch cushions, couch consoles, and outdoor windows. I am truly blown away by these products! The suction power on the 18V ONE+ Stick Vacuum is amazing, especially for the price. Just look at how easily it picks dirt up and the full barrel at the end. These products all get a huge tick of approval from me. The RYOBI ONE+ range is available from Bunnings Warehouse In-store, Online or through Click and Collect.

üìå Step 1: Set the Stage - Ensure your workspace is clutter-free.
üìå Step 2: Power Check - Confirm your battery's raring to go and has enough charge.
üìå Step 3: The Flip Trick - Circular saws cut from the underside up, often leaving a pristine underside and a splintered top. You might want to flip that material.
üìå Step 4: Secure It - Clamp the material down securely.
üìå Step 5: Path Check - Check that the circular saw won‚Äôt be obstructed during the cut
üìå Step 6: Blade Depth - Adjust your blade's depth so 2-3 teeth are exposed on the other side.
üìå Step 7: Gear Up ‚Äì Put on your Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
üìå Step 8: Line it Up - Align the blade so the teeth are just inside the cutting line.
üìå Step 9: Make sure the blade isn‚Äôt touching the material before starting the saw.
üìå Step 10: Firm Grip - Secure the saw with both hands and then turn the saw on.
üìå Step 11: Steady & Ready - Take a deep breath, go steady, and let your tool do the work.

ryobi,"Today I'm on the next step of my mini lawn renovation.¬† 

I'm using the @ryobiau 36V Brushless Scarifier and dethatcher attachment.¬†¬† 

The scarifier blades remove layers of dead grass from your lawn while also slicing into the soil to provide aeration and can be set to 4 different height levels. Scarifying helps to improve nutrient uptake and reduce water logging, which results in a healthier lawn. 

After mowing the lawn on its lowest setting, I'm using the dethatcher attachment which can be purchased separately and involves a less intense process compared to scarifying that doesn't slice into the soil.¬† 

I knew the lawn was pretty neglected, but was amazed at how much thatch came off it!¬†

It literally takes up less than 2 minutes to do inside and outside and we probably do it a few times a day. 

We have the @ryobiau vacuum and blower so that all the batteries are interchangeable with our tools. It‚Äôs a game changer for sure!

ryobi,"Check out how I‚Äôm making my home Christmas-ready with @ryobiau. I have to admit I don‚Äôt clean as often as I should, but getting innovative products has really helped motivate me!
¬†
I‚Äôve tried popular vacuum cleaner brands before, but this 18V Brushless Stick Vac with Dual Roller Kit is seriously good. I love the power behind it, the powered pet tool, and the light! It‚Äôs so good for cleaning dark places (like under the bed).
¬†
And as you can see, I don‚Äôt clean my shower screens as often as I should. It always seems so tedious, but the 18V Window Vacuum Kit does all the heavy lifting for me. I love the spray bottle with the cleaning wipe, then the motored squeegee with suction tool has a vacuum. It‚Äôs seriously amazing.
¬†
Lastly, I love using my balcony, but my tiles have been really dirty. I tried multiple cleaning products and nothing worked. That was until I used the 18V Compact Power Scrubber. There are three attachments - soft, medium and hard bristle brush heads.
¬†
With my @ryobiau cleaning tools, I can spend less time cleaning, and more on decorating and spending time with my loved ones this Christmas.

Enhance your cleaning with @ryobiau - available from your local @bunnings

All of the tools are powered by the same 36V battery and swapping them over is really easy¬†üëå¬†Added bonus is I don't have a car smelling like petrol after transporting everything. 

First I trimmed and tidied the edges, next was mowing the lawn, then onto the hedges and finally tidying up the driveway and paths with the blower. 

I've got the following products in my collection: 

- 36V Brushless Line Trimmer
- 36V HP Lawn Mower
- 36V HP Hedge Trimmer
- 36V 730CFM Blower

ryobi,"I've finally upgraded my petrol lawn mower to a new battery powered 36V Lawn Mower from @ryobiau

I've been using it for a few weeks now and been blown away by how well it works! üí™¬†

I've put it through some pretty thick patches and it hasn't skipped a beat.

The brushless motor has 3 modes to choose from - eco, smart and power. I've been loving the smart mode which automatically draws power from the second battery when the mower senses longer or thicker grass. It can either catch or mulch. I generally catch this section of the lawn that the boys play on and mulch the rest of the yard. 

I can get the whole yard done without needing to swap batteries and now gone are the days of running out of petrol üëå¬†

The kit comes with a 6.0Ah battery and charger but I've got a second battery from the line trimmer meaning I can get the whole yard trimmed and mowed between the 2 batteries¬†üîãüîã

She likes to pump the volume waaaay up on her #Ryobi Radio, especially when Hendrix starts to make that guitar sing! It's awesome hanging with her and sometimes she'll take me as her mascot on the road when heading up for Splendour.

Slash and Ozzie like to crank out their #Ryobi 36V Brushless Mower every Friday and get the band around for a few bevvies.

I'm what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äònovelty gnome‚Äô, bought as a joke, but eventually sold once the humour's lost. Most of my life's been at yard sales. Some gardens were rippa. Others, a bit shabby. I reckon I‚Äôve found a place I can call home though. A few years back I was picked up by two oddballs, James and Taylah. Mate you should see their garden, it's tidy as. They have one of those #Ryobi 18V Garden Shears. James uses it Saturday mornings. That‚Äôs when we have our weekly catch-up. For such a hard life it‚Äôs satisfying to live out my final years here, in paradise.

I didn‚Äôt think her beauty could be replaced. That was until about a year ago. A new gnome graced my garden. Her name was Claire. She stood 2ft tall, long luscious hair, astonishing grey eyes. I think I‚Äôm falling for her. Our owner Charlie bought one of those #Ryobi 36v Hedge Trimmers. He cut about 3ft off the hedge. Now the sun hits Claire‚Äôs hair in a way that needs to be seen to be believed. I‚Äôm happy again, knowing that when I look over the hedge into the sky, Candice is looking back, happy for me too.
