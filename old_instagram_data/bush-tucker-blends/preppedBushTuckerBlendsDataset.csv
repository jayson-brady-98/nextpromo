When the fibres enter your digestive system they encourage production of digestive enzymes which nourish your good bacteria and in turn heals your gut.

🌿Collagen Synthesis - providing a framework of bones, giving strength and structure. Without sufficient vitamin C, the body cannot form collagen properly. 

🌿Antioxidant function - helps protect bone cells from damage caused by free radicals.

🌿Bone Formation - involved in the production of osteoblasts, which are cells responsible for bone formation. 

🌿Enhance Calcium Absorption - a mineral crucial for bone health. By improving calcium absorption, vitamin C ensures an adequate supply of this mineral for bone maintenance.

Adequate intake of vitamin C is essential for maintaining optimal bone health and reducing the risk of conditions such as osteoporosis and fractures. 

Our wild-harvested Kakadu Plum contains the world’s highest source of natural vitamin C having 100 times more than an orange. It also has 15 times more antioxidants than a blueberry and is an excellent source of polyphenols, zinc, copper, magnesium, manganese, riboflavin and more.

bush tucker blends,"One of the key health benefits of the Kakadu plum is its high levels of vitamin C. In fact, it is reported to have up to 100 times more vitamin C than an orange, making it an excellent natural remedy for boosting the immune system. The high levels of vitamin C in the fruit can help to stimulate the production of white blood cells, which are essential for fighting off infections and other nasty intruders.

In addition to its immune-boosting properties, the Kakadu plum also has anti-inflammatory effects. The antioxidants and phytochemicals in the fruit can help to reduce inflammation in the body, which can provide relief from the symptoms of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. 

Another potential benefit of the Kakadu plum is its ability to improve skin health. The fruit’s high levels of vitamin C can help to stimulate collagen production, which can improve the elasticity and firmness of the skin. This can help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and other signs of aging.

In traditional medicine, the Kakadu plum has also been used for its topical benefits. The juice and extract of the fruit have been used to treat wounds, cuts, and burns. It is also believed to have antibacterial properties, which can help to prevent infections.

Overall, the Kakadu plum is a nutritious and versatile fruit that is well worth including in your diet.",19-12-2022,0,,,0,27,1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CmWE7a9gbEx/,

Did you know the main channels of digestion are the gastrointestinal system, the liver and the gallbladder. 

The liver produces bile which supports the breakdown of food, then the GI tract and microbiome further breaks down and absorbs the nutrients. 

Our greens blend includes Vitamin C that supports the liver’s detoxification process, as well as cruciferous vegetables which help the liver produce enzymes for detoxification. 

The gut blend contains digestive enzymes, pre, pro and postbiotics, therefore making it a powerhouse blend for optimal digestion.",05-12-2022,0,,,0,37,2,https://www.instagram.com/p/ClyBW3ogWpD/,

bush tucker blends,"It is a well-known fact that most supplements in today’s market are synthetic, being artificially made within laboratories by scientists. The general consensus is that synthetic nutrients chemical structures are almost completely identical to nature.

then why choose a natural whole food supplement?

* A whole food like Kakadu plum, the star vitamin is vitamin C. However like in many whole-foods there are hundreds of other trace vitamins and minerals that don’t equate to a therapeutic dose and so are seen as insignificant. Now do you think mother nature got it wrong by adding insignificant doses of other vitamins and minerals? Of course not! They work together with the said star vitamin in a synergetic relationship helping to enhance optimal bioavailability and absorption.
* A synthetic supplement made in a lab cherry picks vitamins and minerals and provides it in a therapeutic dose but completely disregards the synergistic relationship of a wholefood.

Now you might be thinking that your synthetic supplement has other cofactors that help absorption, and you’d be right. But these co factors that scientists have researched and added into supplements don’t even begin to scrape the surface of the true magnitude of all other cofactors that are contained within any whole-food. It’s all these tiny and “insignificant” nutrients that allow the star vitamin to do its job the way nature intended.",07-11-2022,0,,,0,37,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckp1Y5Ygrno/,

bush tucker blends,"It’s not new, it’s not a fad, and yet many of you are missing out on the benefits. 

VITAMIN C 

I’m sure when you think of vitamin c, you think of immunity. Whilst it is correct that vitamin c is a super nutrient for our immune systems, it accounts for so much more, but not utilised as well as it should be! 

So what are some incredible benefits of vitamin C 

• In the brain Vitamin C is used as a cofactor to convert dopamine to noradrenaline - a important neurotransmitter associated with attention and concentration, release of hormones, and REM sleep

• In the gut it is essential for the absorption of non-heme iron. It is also involved in the formation of bile acids (who’s role is to eliminate cholesterol, regulate bile acid, lipid and glucose metabolism and modulate temperature and energy homeostasis) 

• In the endocrine system Vitamin C is essential for the formation of corticosteroids (used in the body to reduce inflammation & suppress overactive immune functions). Vitamin C is also essential in forming adrenal hormones, which help regulate your metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, response to stress and other essential functions. 

• Vitamin C is also essential in producing collagen within the body. A protein in the body that benefits skin, connective tissue, bone, muscles, hair and nails

Our Immunity blends gets its Vitamin C from Kakadu Plum as it is the most bioavailable Vitamin C on the market and is known to have up to 100 times the Vitamin C content of oranges.",03-11-2022,0,,,0,26,2,https://www.instagram.com/p/CkfhP1hAVF3/,

Mitochondria are the tiny powerhouses in our body that essentially keep us alive and allow our body to carry out all it’s healing processes.

​Red light does not provide us with vitamin D nor can it burn us, it is really only present on sunrise and sunset for approximately 20mins twice daily.  So if you find that you arent getting sun at these exact times try experiencing red light therapy.

What we have found through our research is that our new recyclable packaging has a far lower environmental impact due to -lighter weight meaning less carbon emissions during transit
- less breakages means less resources are used 
- if put in landfill pouches break down at a profoundly faster rate

You also told us that you wanted the same great blends at a cheaper price point. Moving to recyclable packaging has allowed us to achieve this  all while keeping the efficacy of our blends. No corners were cut  they never will be. 

As stated earlier we will always strive to better ourselves wherever possible so the next logical step for us will be moving to fully compostable packaging in the very near future when we can source a fully compostable zip for our pouches. We aren’t far off!",07-09-2022,0,,,0,56,11,https://www.instagram.com/p/CiMvabZA6Hg/,

bush tucker blends,"In Australia alone many talk shows and studies indicate that over a third of all Australians and up to 45% over 18 years of age get less than the daily recommended amount of sleep. Many attribute this to stresses like work, technology and lifestyle factors and over half of these people have been diagnosed with a sleeping disorder.

 Deep restorative sleep is one of if not the main tools that is the key to optimal health. When you receive deep restful sleep your body undertakes many biological processes that restores, heals and ultimately brings the body back to homeostasis.

When our bodies stay in a heightened or sympathetic state many of these restorative processes are overlooked as it does not recognize these as immediate needs due to being in a fight or flight response.

The great news is that the majority of people who suffer from poor sleep have access to cheap if not free tools that will allow them to improve their sleep quality dramatically. What people need to understand is that good sleep requires good habits and good discipline. It’s a learnt set of behaviours.

  A few things that the team at Bush Tucker Blends do and take to combat;

- Turn off all devices 2 hours before bedtime including no watching TV
- Surround yourself with natural lights like candles, fireplace or yellow lights 2 hours before bedtime
- Invest in blue light blocker glasses and wear them a few hours before bedtime
- Journal about your day to get everything out instead of internalising it when laying in bed
- Meditating to reduce overall cortisol and stress response
- Taking a natural sleep supplement that supports your nervous system and allows you to get a natural deep sleep without the reliance of an addictive drug (Bush Tucker Blends Sleep blend is our go to of course!)",30-08-2022,0,,,0,27,2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch4Kus1v0Mk/,

bush tucker blends,"Just a reminder that nutrients matter!

A well-functioning immune system is essential to survival. Vitamins & minerals are a fundamental part of the immune system and require optimal levels for effective immune function. Nutrient insufficiency/deficiency of one nutrient (Vitamins A, C, D, E, and zinc to name a few) adversely affect immune health, while multiple inadequacies may put the immune system at a bigger deficit. 

Vitamins and minerals are critical for every stage of the immune response. Intake of these vitamins and minerals from the diet supports the body’s initial and adaptive responses required for defense against pathogens.

For instance, vitamin D is known to trigger the production of antimicrobial peptides. Vitamins A, C, D, E, and zinc, are all involved in the innate and/or adaptive immunity immune response. 

Another lifestyle factor that can affect the immune system is inadequate sleep. Approximately 1/3 of Australian adults do not meet the recommended number of sleep hours. A recent report showed a high prevalence of vitamins A, C, D, E, and zinc inadequacies are significantly associated with inadequate sleep, which suggested nutrients play interdisciplinary roles in multiple systems that support immune health.

Your gut is kind of a big deal... Here are some interesting facts you may not know! 

1️⃣ Your gut acts as your second brain! The vagus nerve connects your gut and your brain and they communicate back and forth. A stressed gut= an anxious brain and vice versus! Also, when you eat fiber, your gut bacteria eat the fiber and produce short-chain fatty acids which improve your brain health!

2️⃣ Your gut can help keep your skin clear! When your gut is happy, so is your skin. Improving gut health can improve eczema, psoriasis, and acne!

3️⃣ Your gut houses 70% of your immune system. A healthy gut contains healthy bacteria that supports the immune system to keep you healthy all year long.

4️⃣ Your gut health can improve hormones. You detox hormones (specifically estrogen) through your stool, so pooping every day is essential for hormone health!

5️⃣ The microbiome has more biodiversity than a rainforest. You can think of the gut as the rainforest of your body with the biodiversity it hosts. A diverse microbiome functions best!

Your gut has a HUGE impact on many aspects of your health and probably plays a role in more things than you might think!

There's no doubt that if you take good care of your gut, you will live a healthy, happy life!

bush tucker blends,"Now the majority of us can agree that when you’ve been making poor food choices for a while you start to crave a big bowl of greens or veggies to help neutralize your bad food choices.  There's a good reason for this.  The antioxidants and fibre both help your liver and gut to do their job properly.  Your liver's job is to dump the body’s waste everyday and greens support the liver to do it’s job more efficiently. 

If you can’t get a bowl of greens each day, maybe look at supporting your gut and liver by supplementing with a greens powder like our Good Onya Greens.

bush tucker blends,"There are many ways to tone your vagus nerve but why should we do this?

Your vagus nerve connects your brain to many important organs throughout the body, including the gut (intestines, stomach), heart and lungs plus much more. When you increase your vagal tone it activates the parasympathetic nervous system which ultimately means that your body can relax much quicker after being subjected to stress. 

Ways to tone or train your vagus nerve are deep slow breath training, cold exposure, exercise in general or more specifically strength training and high intensity interval training, taking a probiotic, meditation, ho’oponopono, sauna, singing, humming, chanting, gargling to name a few.

bush tucker blends,"Don’t be fooled by industry marketing tricks. You need to know what you're looking for so here’s a few tips.

1. Read the ingredients list to look if your brand/blend you're buying uses non synthetic ingredients and no fillers, colours, preservatives etc

2. Secondly and very importantly make sure that these ingredients add up to a therapeutic dose.

For example, two brands might both list kakadu plum, orange juice powder, camu camu or acerola cherry but the actual vitamin C content in one might be so low that it does nothing at all. 

You need to check the nutritional panel and compare the doses carefully. You might pay a cheaper price but be getting no nutritional benefit if any at all. It’s all in the detail.",15-03-2022,0,,,0,-1,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CbHqDs7PXxM/,

bush tucker blends,"Many people don’t realise they are low in vitamin D. Of those people who have had their levels tested and are low, they believe that their lack of Vitamin D is due to their diet or lack of sunlight. In plenty of cases this is true. However, 80% of how your body converts sunlight into Vitamin D is due to your genetics. Many people have genes that negatively impact the way they absorb sunlight and turn that into useable vitamin D. So if you are getting plenty of sunlight and you are low in vitamin D there’s a good chance it’s due to your genetics. This important vitamin is actually a hormone and is responsible for immunity (especially against respiratory viruses), healthy hormone levels, bone health, thyroid health, autoimmunity plus much much more. The easiest solution is to find a great absorbable form vitamin D3 and aim to get your levels over 100.  This is integral in these times we are living in.

bush tucker blends,"Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. This is because when you breathe deeply, it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax. The brain then sends this message to your body. Breathing exercises are a great way to relax, reduce tension, and relieve stress. 

The science and research indicate that deep breathing and toning the Vagus nerve helps to decrease inflammation and improve immune system regulation, metabolism, emotional regulation, and improve anxiety and depression symptoms too. It also helps with cravings and optimal brain focus and functioning

On the contrary activity in the amygdala suggests that quick breathing rates may trigger feelings like anxiety, anger, or fear. Further studies have shown that we tend to be more attuned to fear when we're breathing quickly. 

So all in all the science is out that our mental state is directly affected by our breath. 

Next time you are stuck in fight or flight put one hand on your heart, the other on your tummy and breathe in for 5, hold for 5, breathe out for 5. Continue this for a minute and tune in to how you feel.

It also has the added benefit of having powerful Australian Native superfoods which have strong antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

Now don’t get us wrong, science is amazing at dealing with acute illness or injury but not chronic conditions. Most chronic conditions come from lifestyle choices like poor diet. We then believe that we can bolster this crappy diet by throwing some synthetic vitamins down our gobs to neutralise the Macca’s we just ate. Not the case. 

Our bodies were designed to absorb whole foods which typically have a hero vitamin or mineral alongside 100’s if not 1000’s of other co-nutrients. These so called negligible co-nutrients we ignore in our synthetic vitamin supplements are the key to absorption. That’s why we recommend supplementing with wholefood supplements alongside eating a wholefood diet.

We stop listening to life’s subtle signs that tend to nudge us in the right direction if we start veering of course. Over weeks, months and years we can find ourselves in bad health, in average or bad life situations or just simply no longer vibrant.

Then why choose a natural whole food supplement?

* A whole food like Kakadu plum, the star vitamin is vitamin C. However like in many whole-foods there are hundreds of other trace vitamins and minerals that don’t equate to a therapeutic dose and so are seen as insignificant. Now do you think mother nature got it wrong by adding insignificant doses of other vitamins and minerals? Of course not! They work together with the said star vitamin in a synergetic relationship helping to enhance optimal bioavailability and absorption.

* A synthetic supplement made in a lab cherry picks vitamins and minerals and provides it in a therapeutic dose but completely disregards the synergistic relationship of a whole-food.

Now you might be thinking that your synthetic supplement has other cofactors that help absorption, and you’d be right. But these co factors that scientists have researched and added into supplements don’t even begin to scrape the surface of the true magnitude of all other cofactors that are contained within any whole-food.

Firstly, the words “all natural” don’t often mean that at all. More often than not, companies will create a blend with some whole foods but they will bolster the blends with synthetic lab made vitamins, fillers and flavours.

Also, synthetic vitamins and fillers are cheaper to make (that’s why everyone uses them) but they are also no where near as bioavailable as a wholefood straight from nature. 

We proudly stand by the fact that we don’t use ANYTHING synthetic not even flavouring. To go real deep we don’t even use natural flavours as the natural flavour often sits on a synthetic carrier.

Marine collagen peptides are absorbed up to 1.5 times more efficiently in the body, and the bioavailability is superior to collagen of both bovine or porcine. The smaller particle size in marine collagen compared to other sources allows an easier and faster uptake and transportation of the collagen peptides to the skin, bones and joints for the synthesis of new collagen.

Photosynthesis is the process of absorbing energy from sunlight and using it to produce food in the form of sugars. Leaves make it possible for plants to fulfill their role as primary producers in food chains. 

Not only do leaves make food, but they also generate oxygen during photosynthesis and are major contributors to the cycle of carbon and oxygen in the environment. 

Dead leaves then drop and decompose which returns valuable nutrients back to the soil which helps new plants regrow. The life cycle of a humble leaf.",19-05-2021,0,,,0,34,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPDPxSFH0wD/,

We strongly believe that to truly live a healthy life and to “heal” you need to address both the emotional and spiritual aspects of your life. For this reason we have decided to support ANTAC who foster the Ngangkari people of Australia.

Ngangkari people are traditional Aboriginal Healers. Traditional Aboriginal healing is as old as the culture itself. Over a long time Aboriginal healers built a body of knowledge based on the resources and wisdom they found on the land. In Aboriginal culture the Ngangkari are seen to be equal to that of a modern day Doctor. The reason for this like many eastern style medical practices is that Indigenous Aboriginals see the mind, body and spirit as one.",30-03-2021,0,,,0,64,8,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDkow7H1Ew/,

It also has a high potassium to sodium ratio, which may help to reduce blood pressure.

bush tucker blends,"Nourish yourself inside and out. Not only should you immerse yourself in nature  physically, we believe to truely nourish yourself you should also ingest nature. 

When ingesting nature (whole foods) direct from the earth, profound healing effects take place in your body. As everything you ingest has the ability to speak to every cell in your body. Seems pretty simple? But it’s so surprising how we as humans have lost touch and supposedly outsmarted ourselves by creating ready made processed foods and began supplementing with lab made synthetic vitamins. 

When you couple eating whole foods with immersing yourself in nature, whether it be a hike in the hills, a swim in the creek, a surf in the ocean or simply walking barefoot on the grass, again, profound healing takes place. You become more relaxed, clear minded and balanced as you start to recalibrate with the slow pace of the environment around you.

bush tucker blends,"Your mind and body are powerful allies. How you think can affect how you feel. And how you feel can affect your thinking.

An example of this is how your body responds to stress. When you're stressed or anxious, your body reacts as if it is under attack,  your heart rate and breathing increase, your blood pressure  goes up, and your muscles become tense and pain can set in. This reaction is called the fight-or-flight response. 

On the other hand, if you practice mindful movement and breathing, like done in yoga for example, this activates the rest-and-digest system via the vagus nerve. Consequently, this moves the nervous system out of the fight or flight response associated with stress, and into the “rest and digest” response—increasing emotional well-being.

Nothing happens in the body without the brain telling it to. The brain is “the hardware” that allows us to experience the thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and emotions that we collectively call the “mind.”

So in short, balance is key, be present, focus on the breathe and get in touch with your body.",03-03-2021,0,,,0,66,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CL82ewFHkvk/,

Our soils are depleted of nutrients due to mono farming and pesticide use up to 50% less nutrients than 50 years ago.

Our daily stressors are way higher which in turn makes our bodies demand more nutrients to combat these stressors. 

Our environmental toxins being air quality, water quality, deodorants, body lotions, sunscreens, processed foods and much more all contribute to higher toxic loads again putting the body into a higher stressed state.
