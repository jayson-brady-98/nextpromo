terratonics,"THE FREQUENCIES OF PLANTS

While plants don’t create music in the traditional sense, their resonance can be harnessed to generate unique soundscapes. By attaching sensors to leaves and stems, we can translate electrical signals produced by plants into audible tones and rhythms.

These signals, influenced by light, touch, and even the plant’s emotional state, create a symphony of organic sounds. Artists and musicians have utilised this phenomenon to create “plant music,” offering a new perspective on nature’s hidden language.

This emerging field of biofeedback sonification not only offers artistic possibilities but also provides insights into plant communication and environmental responses. 

That may be why we feel so calm in nature; her music aligns most with our bodies.

terratonics,"You’ve heard it a million times because it’s true. Prevention is your most powerful ally. But hold tight; we’re not going to reel off the usual list of things. 

Yes, don’t bake yourself in the sun or drink too much. But we’re also human and have lives full of experiences and learnings. When we’re young, it’s hard to imagine being old, and when we’re old, we forget what it was to be young. 

Don’t fret if you feel like you’re only now starting to practice self-care. The human body has an unbelievable ability to regenerate and heal. 

Our go-to primary treatments for maintaining and unearthing your natural beauty are drinking plenty of natural spring water and eating a predominantly plant-based diet full of living foods bursting with antioxidants. Your body is its microcosm made of trillions of cells and bacteria. You look after them, and they look after you. 

What you remove is possibly more important than what you add. The two big ones are avoiding processed sugar and tap water. We all know about sugar, but tap water is still relatively unknown. Most municipal supplies contain dangerous chemicals, antibiotics, and microplastics. You are a water being; 99.9% of you is made up of water, so honouring that, you will thrive.

Tonics - Restore and promote health and well-being

Terra Tonics was created as a choice, a choice to do better every day, for our health, the planet and all sentient beings we share it with. 

From day one, every choice we’ve made has your health and planetary health at its core, each with a deep connection to the other.

“The human body resonates at the same frequency as Mother Earth.

So instead of only focusing on trying to save the earth, which operates in congruence to our vibrations, I think it is more important to be one with each other. If you really want to remedy the earth, we have to mend mankind. And to unite mankind, we heal the Earth. That is the only way.

Mother Earth will exist with or without us. Yet if she is sick, it is because mankind is sick and separated. And if our vibrations are bad, she reacts to it, as do all living creatures.”

The Clean Collagen Advantage.

2—Ingredients your skin craves. We use only 100% botanical extracts that evolved with your biology. It’s what your skin is designed to receive.

3—Real building blocks. Our ingredients allow your skin to make its OWN collagen with botanicals that contain the same molecular structure as your cells.

We’re not about quick fixes. Clean Collagen is about a skin transformation—fine lines fade, dry and oily patches heal, and your natural glow emerges as a vibrant expression of your skin’s true potential.

I was also like that. For most of my life I felt like a prisoner in my own body, soaking in the societal and environmental programming about Not Being Enough. 

But I’ve come a long way since then and I feel that so many things fell into alignment when I changed the language I used with my body. I arrived (and still arriving). 

The more lovingly I spoke to myself, the clearer my skin was, the lighter I felt (I actually lost so much weight by losing stuck emotions), my hormones balanced out and I felt so much inner radiance coming through. 

It was a journey, not a quick fix. 🚂 

But now I feel passionate about sharing that wisdom and practices with others, especially with women who can relate to my story. 

A special thanks goes to @terratonics for empowering me in my journey of owning my skin, feeling confident in it and continuously glowing through my skincare rituals 🧖🏼‍♀️

terratonics,"CLEAN COLLAGEN.
Why supporting your own Collagen production with plant sources is the best way to glowing skin without the negative environmental impact.

Collagen has been a hot topic for quite some time in the beauty industry but what isn’t mentioned with animal collagen is it’s harmful effects on the planet.

As we know animal farming at its current scale is destroying our planet. Whether it's the Amazon being cut down to make room for animal crops or grazing, to land worldwide dedicated to animal farming that could be converted back to its natural state, to draw down carbon and increase biodiversity. The methane gases which pollute our atmosphere to our overfished oceans. Mass animal agriculture is a disaster for our planet and the animals themselves.

""Collagen is created by boiling cow bones, as well as other body parts, according to Healthline. Slaughtering the cows, especially for commercial use, comes with quite a bit of abuse. In addition to fact that they are killed, cows raised for commercial use are generally raised in highly unsuitable and often inhumane conditions.” 

Our lifestyle choices are fundamental to maintaining and supporting our collagen production. “Your body makes collagen and other proteins by combining various amino acids.

Eating a variety of foods ensures that you have the nutrients you need to produce collagen and other proteins, without the trouble, expense and uncertainty of relying on a supplement.”
- University of Texas, MD Anderson Centre

Plant Based collagen works with your biology and signals your body to upregulate and support its OWN collagen production.

Animal based collagen aims to add additional collagen to your body. However, the molecular size is too big to penetrate, so it just sits on the surface of your skin.

Terra Tonics Clean Collagen
Bio-Active Plant Serum + Natural Retinol is formulated with just 5 efficacious botanicals.

Our high percentage, active, stable and natural source of Vitamin C* (essential for collagen) is just one of the many unique reasons Clean Collagen offers such amazing results.

Better for your skin, the animals and the planet.

terratonics,"Warm Water + Your Skin
In Ayurveda, regularly drinking warm water, especially in the morning, can work on healing our body by providing digestive power and reducing the metabolic waste that could have built up in our immune system.
 
Warm water is a natural body regulator. Drinking a glass of warm water in the morning can help cleanse your body by flushing out toxins. Warm water helps break down the food in the stomach and keeps the digestive system on track. 
 
When our body accumulates toxins, it becomes prone to illness and ageing. Warm water helps cleanse the body from those toxins and repairs skin cells, which also supports your skin's elasticity.

Our skin health is more than just what we put on our skin, which is why we believe in a holistic approach.

Seven per cent of the world's flora biodiversity is found in Australia, with 92 per cent of these plant species unique to this country.  The wonders of Australia’s native plants may not be widely known or appreciated but for the traditional custodians of this land these plants are a life source. 

Take Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) for instance it was not until the 1980s that western research discovered its many wonders but this very plant was being used extensively by indigenous cultures all around Australia for several millennia.

This incredible fruit contains 100 times the vitamin C of an orange, two-and-a-half times an açai berry, and almost five times the antioxidant properties of blueberries. Kakadu plum’s benefits for skin are quite simply unparalleled when delivered in its full plant matrix.

There is also a broader understanding of incorporating these botanicals into our life. In traditional indigenous culture, the healing process often involves spiritual and physical components. Healing requires a spiritual doctor as well as a healer. Spiritual disharmony has to be addressed for healing to occur.

terratonics,"“Something that is created by the whole is going to be more intelligent than something created by the part.” 

Synthetics in skincare are often just one molecule synthesised in a lab to replicate what is found in nature. The idea is you isolate that one active to deliver results.

The problem with this approach is that it removes that molecule from the intelligent plant matrix, where nature designed it to work in synergy with all the other molecules. Just how your body works in harmony with all its cells in communication with one another, the same is true for plants.

Our process of cellular extraction suspends in a liquid matrix, the bio-structure of nature’s brilliant design. Tested and refined over billions of years and delivered fully alive and active.

terratonics,"Are you using clean skincare but toxic makeup?

The key to minimal skincare and healthy skin is to start by removing the products causing a toxic load.

By layering synthetic or chemical laden makeup on top, it’s like washing your hair in muddy water. You’re trying to clean it but adding more dirt at the same time.

You need to bring the skin right back to basics, and this also includes makeup. Choosing makeup that's natural and uses plant and mineral ingredients to compliment your skincare. 

By replacing synthetics with plants and minerals, the compounds will restore your skin’s natural hydrating processes, strengthen its natural protective barrier and balance PH levels.

Minimal skincare is also cheaper. Using more effective skincare products, the fewer you need. Not to mention the positive effect it has on the environment by not over-consuming.

terratonics,"As we move through life and past our mid - late 20’s, we start to lose collagen naturally. Not surprisingly, it's also accelerated by a poor diet, alcohol and smoking. Sadly, collagen doesn't like to party. It's less 90s party and more new agey, green juice vibes. 

Collagen is the glue that holds you together and provides your skin with its structure, strengthening hair, nails and bones while ensuring your joints move smoothly. 

So what is collagen made of? Three amino acids - glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline.  These 3 amino acids are synthesised with Vitamin C to produce collagen. Your body doesn't naturally produce vitamin C, it has to be derived from your food. 

Zinc is also a cofactor in the production of collagen. It plays a vital role in collagen synthesis. It is essential to cell repair and helps protect collagen in the body from damage. Zinc deficiency can reduce the amount of collagen produced.

Copper is also an essential mineral in collagen production and is also required for the formation of red blood cells, bone, and connective tissue. Copper activates an enzyme (lysyl oxidase) required for collagen maturation, which helps form the fibres that support your tissues.

terratonics,"Botanical Hyaluronic VS Synthetic Hyaluronic Acid.

There is no doubt that topical synthetic HA can give you short term results. This is because it draws all the moisture to the top layer of your skin making it appear plump. However, that moisture doesn’t get locked in and eventually evaporates, resulting in more dehydrated skin over time as more and more moisture is pulled to the surface only to disappear. 

What makes this worse is people use synthetic HA in low humidity conditions, yet this is when it leaves skin even dryer by accelerating transepidermal water loss through the same process of drawing all your skin’s moisture to the surface, and at the time when you most need moisture in your skin. 

This is where Cellular Hydration and synthetic HA differ. This deeply moisturising serum works with your biology to keep your skin in balance, allowing your skin to regulate the correct amount of moisture rather than simply drawing all the moisture it can find to the surface to only have it evaporate. 

Botanical Hyaluronic Acid has an improved ability to penetrate the skin to act from within, like your own natural HA. 

Cellular Hydration also has the capability of making up for that lost, naturally occurring HA in your skin since it mimics the same polysaccharides.

Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Cellular Hydration’s single ingredient, has been clinically proven to be a more potent hydrator than synthetic HA over 24 hours.  

What’s even more important, is its results compound overtime. Your skin will become more naturally hydrated rather than dehydrated.

Movement is essential not only for a healthy body, mind, and spirit but also for healthy skin. 

Movement and exercise have just so many benefits for your skin. 

I always like to think of everything in my body in a constant state of movement, cells endlessly replacing themselves as my entire electromagnetic being vibrates in and out of the morphic field. But that's just me... 

Everything in our body is in constant movement, and for it to stay healthy, we need to be too. 

Your lymphatic system is pivotal for radiant skin. Think of it as your filtration system and garbage bin. 

When the lymph is congested, it can cause dry skin, blemishes, rashes, eczema, psoriasis, cellulite and the build-up of free radicals, all leading to accelerated ageing. 

Unlike the heart, the lymph has no pump to keep it moving, so it relies on us for assistance.

Keep your lymph circulating with yoga, dance, running and stretching, to name a few. 

The more waste your lymph system can eliminate, the healthier you and your skin can be.

terratonics,"""We are an intensely social and ritualistic species.""

Rituals, a series of actions performed in a specific way, have been part of human existence for thousands of years.

 In a University of Toronto study, participants who performed a ritual before completing a task exhibited less anxiety and sensitivity to personal failure than when they completed the task without first performing the ritual.

Rituals benefit our physical well-being and immune system. According to Andrew Newberg, the associate director of research at the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health, rituals also lower cortisol, reduce heart rate and blood pressure and increase immune system function.

Psychologist Hobson confirms that rituals aren't just beneficial to our mental health—they're essential. ""We are an intensely social and ritualistic species,"" he says. ""Take this piece out of our modern human narrative and you lose a piece of our history and our humanity.""

In this age of isolation, we need nourishing and uplifting means of creating community by bringing together members of different generations as our ancestors did.

Rituals can help us, though, by offering our communities opportunities for healing and support.""

A multi-directional serum with potent compounds that help with acne prone skin.

+ Tartaric Acid - works to clear blocked pores. 

+ Protocatechuic Acid - helps to reduce redness and calm the skin.

+ Native River Mint - a potent anti-microbial and aids with improved cell turnover, exfoliation and even skin tone.

+ Bakuchiol - unlike retinoids, has antibacterial and anti-fungal activity against propionibacterium acnes (one of the bacterias responsible for acne) or candida.

Bakuchiol exfoliates to remove dirt, dead skin cells, and oil from pores. This can help prevent the formation of pimples. 

It also literally gets under your skin, unlike many other acne treatments. Tiny molecules penetrate the middle layer of your dermis, stimulating collagen and elastin production. These compounds fight acne indirectly by reducing the appearance of pores and acne scarring over time.

terratonics,"The Mind Skin Connection

Though some anxiety is useful and causes us to take action to avoid potentially negative situations for our future selves, it is vastly different from longterm stress and anxiety which leaves us in a permanent state of ‘fight or flight’.

Our body doesn’t understand the difference between the stress response of fight or flight—whether we’re being chased by a saber-toothed tiger, or whether we think our bum looks big in those expensive new jeans we shouldn’t have bought.

It is processed by our body all the same and comes and creates a host of damaging hormones.

Stress causes inflammation in the body which is beneficial if it’s brief but if we’re constantly living with the hormones of stress it weakens our immune system which can cause our skin to react negatively.

Our skin is a reflection on what is going on deeper in the epidermis and in our bodies.

It’s incredible to think that in our modern society stress in 99% of cases is solely due to our thoughts.

So how do we release stress in the moment and allow our skin to flourish?

terratonics,"PLASTIC

It's all around us, in our oceans, our rivers, our rain and even our food.  And, it's not just our planet's health but also our own health we need to think about. 

So what can we do?

I feel the first step is to bring more awareness into our everyday life. Asking the questions, what do I currently use that's plastic and single-use? How can I reduce or stop using them altogether? 

Once we establish the area's where change needs to occur we can take steps in a new direction. It has to start somewhere, so why not with each of us?  Even when the problem seems enormous and out of our control, we can still take ownership of how we want the world to be.

I began by writing a list (like a typical Virgo). Writing down all of the things in my house that could be swapped, reused or refilled instead of thrown out. This process made me hyper-aware of how much plastic I was using without thinking about it. Now there are so many more places where we can reuse jars to fill up household products, foods and even wine. 

I think back only a few generations; people lived in a world without plastic without any issues. Convenient's and speed can’t come at the cost of our health or planet. It's not about returning to the past but questioning the unnecessary packaging and consumption prevalent in our world. It’s up to us to demand from our favourite brands to move toward sustainable practices.

We are all learning, and if we can start a conversation or share our journey and  inspire one person or business to make a swap, then that's one less piece of plastic out there. Our actions have so much more of a profound effect on others than we think. If more of us start doing this, then that's a lot less waste. 

We all want to live in a world with clean oceans and rivers, clean food and water.

Transformation begins with each one of us. 

What's one swap you can make today?

It’s because nature has a way of energetically interacting with us through vibration and frequency.

Plants emit communication through vibrations, similar to the way in which we use our voice to speak, or the way we project our emotions.

Interestingly, plants can receive vibrational information from us humans, both through the ultraviolet and infrared light that we emit, and also through the mix of vibration generated by our voice, thoughts and emotions.

This concept of frequency and energy extends beyond plants, too.‘

I find it a clear reminder of how connected with nature we are.

Whatever your beliefs around the moon’s cycles and there connection to us, there is no argument that the majesty and beauty of these occasions remind us that we are a part of a larger system.

There has been a lot of marketing around collagen skincare and supplements but what constitutes animal sources of collagen and is it good for you? 

Most animal collagen is a by-product of factory farming, where pesticides and herbicides like glyphosate are stored in the bones.

Many other contaminants are often found including antibiotics, prescription drug metabolites, steroids, insecticides, and parabens.

Aside from personal health concerns the other enormous issue with animal sources of collagen is the environmental impact.

….

The main problem for your skin with animal-based collagen is it doesn’t confront the root cause of collagen loss.

terratonics,"Vitamin c, your skin & collagen.

Vitamin c is essential for collagen production. Since your body can’t produce vitamin c on its own you must get it through fresh fruits, vegetables, spices, seeds and nuts.

Up until very recently, it was impossible to apply natural vitamin c topically to your skin.

Natural vitamin c is notoriously unstable. The antioxidants it in would perish within a very short period rendering a product useless. That's if they survived the extraction process to begin with.

The way skincare companies have tried to get around this has been to use synthetic shelf-stable vitamin c which would generally be labelled as 'Ascorbic Acid'.

Unfortunately, synthetic vitamin c is nothing like natural vitamin c. Synthetic vitamin c contains no antioxidant properties (you read that correctly) because it’s missing the molecule that makes natural vitamin c active and an antioxidant.

It just so happens it’s this molecule is the same molecule which makes natural vitamin c unstable, so it can't be replicated synthetically because then you’d have unstable synthetic vitamin c and the same issue.

Due to an innovation in the extraction process (really an innovation in skincare) for the first time we are able to extract natural vitamin c that is shelf stable and 100% ACTIVE with the antioxidant properties intact.

40% of Clean Collagen is comprised of Kakadu Plum
Kakadu Plum contains 100 times more vitamin c than an orange. Clean Collagen also contain Finger Lime which is incredibly high in vitamin c.

There is nothing more effective for your collagen production than the power of natural vitamin c.

One of the benefits of using bakuchiol over natural retinol is that it doesn’t make your skin sun sensitive. It’s also scientifically proven to be as effective as traditional retinol.

A new study by the University of California, published in The British Journal of Dermatology, compared the clinical efficacy of bakuchiol  and retinol in improving common signs of cutaneous facial ageing. The results: “bakuchiol and retinol both significantly decreased wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation, with no statistical difference between the compounds” although “the retinol users reported more facial skin scaling and stinging”.

Why would you use traditional retinol? No, we don’t know why either.

The ingredients we choose are of the highest quality, in terms of purity and of the effects they offer. Which, is of course why we use them. Each offering their own unique benefits.

Each one is offered at a high percentage for optimal results. No unnecessary or watered down elements. If it has such amazing benefits why use it at such a tiny percentage?

There are so many unquestioned and questionable practices in skincare, mostly based around profit margins and not longterm skin health and results.

terratonics,"DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ YOUR SKINCARE LABELS?

All labels by law have to list their ingredients on the back from the highest amount in the product, to the lowest.

When a skincare brand markets a specific ingredient to sell you their product, is this listed at the top or even the top 3? You’ll be very surprised when you check.

Many brands will say they use Kakadu Plum to get your attention yet, is it in there at only 5% or less? Even 1%?

The reason we give you in depth information about our ingredients is because we offer all our ingredients at high percentages, pure, active and not watered down.

Kakadu Plum is at the top of our list for Clean Collagen because it constitutes 50% of the formulation. Work your way down our label to Bakuchiol at 4%, the highest amount proven to work safely.

Our salt based preserver, sodium benzoate, is obviously at the bottom at 0.2% which is the minimum amount required to maintain the potency of the extracts for the entirety of their shelf life.

So why not choose to give your skin and body the best of what nature offers? There is no need for watered down, synthetic products on the market, nature is all around us and offers amazing benefits.

The reason we achieve such fantastic results is because we focus on making the purest, most powerful skincare and not on misleading marketing.",11-07-2020,0,N/A,N/A,0,92,5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCfYqyNjHXh/,N/A
terratonics,"A tree is an incredible thing. It is a home for animals, it supplies shade for anyone who chooses to stand underneath it and, is a thing of beauty.

A tree captures carbon and gives us our very life itself with the oxygen it releases. Yet even with these life-giving traits, our culture still views a tree purely as a utility - a tree has its own life and is connected to other organisms in ways we are just starting to glimpse at. It carries ancient wisdom and deep intelligence.

The abundant, giving nature of a tree is something we as human beings could learn a lot from.

For all our technological advancements, we must never lose sight of the genius and abundant nature of a single tree, our lives depend on this fundamental truth.

terratonics,"Animal sources of collagen are not necessary, or effective for plump, radiant skin.

Our bodies produce collagen daily to support our needs. As we age, the speed at which it produces slows down.

To keep producing collagen effectively it needs support. Collagen is made from, Vitamin C, amino acids & minerals. Vitamin C is inextricably necessary for collagen, without it your body just can not produce it.

The main problem with animal based collagen is it doesn’t confront the root cause of collagen loss. It’s like trying to fill a bucket with water that has a hole rather than fixing the bucket.

Most collagen sources are derived from ground up bones, hides, hooves, horns, fish scales and other parts of animals unnecessarily.

Contaminants are normally found in animal sources of collagen as they are generally a by-product of factory farming.

Plant based sources of collagen are there to support the natural system of our body to build its own collagen.

At Terra Tonics ethical, cruelty free and sustainable practices are a priority in every area of of our business.

terratonics,"One of the main pillars for radiant skin:

Hydration.

50% of the ageing process is due to dehydration. By adding moisture to the skin via oils or moisturiser doesn’t get to the root cause of dehydration and dry skin.

Often, dehydration and dry skin is due to the barrier function of the skin being disrupted making it unable to lock in moisture.

The skin must be repaired at the cellular level to enable this barrier function to work correctly.

Clean Collagen is a water soluble serum, meaning it penetrates deeply, allowing its active ingredients to repair and heal the skin’s natural barrier function so moisture is  retained.

terratonics,"When it come to collagen production the main key is Vitamin C, which regulates the formation of the two proteins required for collagen.

To keep your skin plump and youthful, your skin benefits best from topically applied Vitamin C rather than in tablet or powder form used for overall health.

Vitamin C is also a very powerful antioxidant that protects the skin against free radicals, which accelerate the ageing of skin.

These reasons amongst many are why we use Kakadu plum, the world's richest source of Vitamin C. Kakadu Plums can contain 3000mg of Vitamin C per 100g of fruit, more than fifty times the amount found in oranges.

They were made from watered-down ingredients, fillers, synthetically synthesised (not pure) natural ingredients and animal products that were not just cruel—but dramatically less beneficial than plant-based sources. And, when products did contain bio-active ingredients, they made up less than 1% of the total components.
