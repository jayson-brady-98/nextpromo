nutra organics,"It is highly unlikely that Bovaer has been used in our supply chain. Following a thorough audit of our international supply chain, our trusted partners (who provide us with the high-quality, premium ingredients you know and love) have informed us that while unlikely, they cannot definitively rule out the use of Bovaer. This is due to the nature of their operations: their cattle are primarily grass-fed, but may occasionally receive supplemental feed during severe weather conditions. Consequently, the likelihood of Bovaer being used in their supply chain is minimal. However, given the expansive global network of farms they work with, and the fact that Bovaer is legally permitted in over 60 countries, a guarantee cannot be provided. ⁠
⁠
We have always upheld the principle that if something isn’t good enough for our own families, it’s not good enough for our community.

How incredible are our bodies 🤩

The things my body has gone through I couldn’t love it more. 🙌🏻

So ensuring I provide my body with the best nutrients possible is important. Collagen is our most abundant protein jn our body - it looks after all our connective tissue - think beyond hair skin and nails - think your ligaments and tendons. That hold your body together 👊🏻

As we age our stores deplete - so supplanting our collagen is key to maintaining our collagen stores. 

@nutraorganics Collagen Build is full of collagen peptides ensuring you get exactly what you need. In high quantities so you’re giving your body exactly what it needs to thrive. 

I have been taking collagen build since I was pregnant with Harper (6.5 years ago) And being a year off 40 - I can tell you I only feel stronger and stronger as the years go on 🥰

Use code THEFIGURE at check out. Looking after YOU is a non negotiable in my books 👊🏻

If you are wanting to create a dish, THE DISH, that everyone will ask you to make again & again it’s this…

Ingredients:
	⁃	Roughly 1kg of white potatoes (OR mix it up with half white, half sweet which is PERFECTION, I just didn’t have any sweet potatoes on hand).
	⁃	Half a bunch of diced Spring Onion
	⁃	@nutraorganics Chicken Bone Broth Concentrate.
	⁃	Drizzle of oil (to oil your dish)
	⁃	2 cups of Tasty Cheese (the more cheese the merrier babes, don’t by shy).
	⁃	600ml Thickened Cream.
	⁃	Herbamere, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder & a handful of dried veggies (all of this is your herbs/spices that you’ll whisk into the cream.)

Method:
	⁃	Preheat oven to 175 degrees
	⁃	Wash, peel & slice potatoes.
	⁃	Bring water to boil & add your @nutraorganics Chicken Bone Broth Concentrate.
	⁃	Add potatoes & par-boil until slightly soft.
	⁃	Drain Potatoes (& keep the water as it makes an excellent base for gravy!).
	⁃	Lightly oil your dish.
	⁃	Start to layer your potatoes, then sprinkle spring onion & cheese.
	⁃	Repeat this layering process until dish is full or you’ve finished your potatoes.
	⁃	Whisk together cream, herbs & spices & give it a taste to find the right amount for your buds!
	⁃	Pour mixture over your layered potatoes.
	⁃	Place in oven for roughly 35-40mins or until golden brown on top. 

& THAT, my friends, is how you make the world’s GREATEST Scallop Potatoes! 👏🏻

nutra organics,"Navigating the world of collagen can feel a little crazy, trust us, we get it! From liquids, topical creams, powders and even gummies, to the source of where it’s from, the variety just seems endless! 😱⁠
⁠
And when we talk about collagen types - like 1,2 or 3 - it might just sound like a crazy science experiment gone wrong. Plus, with all the different types and terms (like bioactive or hydrolysed collagen), it's enough to make your head spin! 😵‍💫 But don’t worry, we’re here to break it down for you!⁠
⁠
We’ll start with Collagen “Types” 1, 2, and 3. These refer to the forms of collagen found in our bodies, with each type serving unique roles. Type 1 is abundant in our skin, bones, and connective tissues, offering elasticity and strength. Type 2 is key for cartilage, giving our joints flexibility. Type 3 supports the structure of muscles, organs, and arteries. At Nutra, we focus on Types 1 and 3 because they're not only commonly found in our bodies but also the easiest for our bodies to absorb and utilise, as they mimic the collagen naturally found in human skin and bones.⁠
⁠
Hydrolysed Collagen refers to collagen that has been broken down into smaller peptides, 🧬 making it easier for our bodies to digest and absorb. This process ensures that when you take our collagen, you're getting the most out of it.⁠
⁠
Bioactive simply means that the collagen is in a form that your body can recognise and use effectively. 🛠 It's active and ready to go to work helping improve your skin, hair, nails, and overall health! ⁠

⁠
1. Wholefood vitamins and minerals are easier on the body⁠
They are better absorbed & more bioavailable ⁠
⁠
2. Wholefood vitamins and minerals require lower doses⁠
They are activated at a higher ratio than synthetics⁠
⁠
3. Wholefood vitamins and minerals come with other nutrients!⁠
They are superior to lab-made which typically don’t have micronutrients⁠
⁠
4. Wholefoods are familiar to the body⁠
Our bodies have been processing them for centuries!⁠

1. Hugh Jackman loves our Super Greens + Reds 🧔🏻‍♂️⁠

⁠
4. We source every ingredient in our products ourselves (over 1000 of them!) 🌱⁠

5. In 2010 our founders Mark & Darlene sold their family home to fund the Nutra Organics dream. 🏡⁠

6. Up until we had 20 staff (around 2018), Darlene used to cook lunch for every team member every day. 🥗⁠

⁠
Droooool! We love seeing the beautiful recipes everyone creates. This mouthwatering tart is Kailey's version of @sheridanjoyaustin OG recipe. ⁠
⁠
Wish we had a slice sitting in front of us right now. For anyone else who's feeling the same, here's Sheridan's recipe.⁠
⁠
Base 🍪⁠
2 cups blanched almond meal�⁠
1 egg�⁠
4 tablespoons collagen⁠
3 tablespoons coconut oil�⁠
2 teaspoons vanilla essence�⁠
3 tablespoons sweetener (coconut sugar, maple syrup) ⁠
⁠
Filling 🍋⁠
240g melted ghee⁠
12 room-temperature egg yolks⁠
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice at room temperature⁠
4 tablespoons passion fruit pulp⁠
120g your choice of granulated sweetener⁠
2 tsp vanilla essence⁠
⁠
Method:⁠
1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.⁠
⁠
2. Blend, press down into the tart tin mould with your hands until even in thickness, poke a few holes with a fork, and bake for 15 minutes, or until slightly golden. Allow to cool before adding the curd.⁠
⁠
3. Melt ghee in a saucepan over medium to low heat.⁠
⁠
4. Whisk in the sweetener, lemon juice and passion fruit. Stir through until the sweetener dissolves. ⁠
⁠
5. Add yolks and continue to whisk over medium heat until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon.⁠
⁠
6. Once the cookie crust and curd cools slightly (leave the curd not too firm or even re-blend it slightly if it firmed up too much!) pour it in. The longer you allow it to cool, the thicker it will become.⁠

⁠
Her recipe is below: ⁠
⁠
Broth - ⁠
1/2 onion⁠
3 slices ginger⁠
clove of garlic⁠
spring onion (whites)⁠
coriander stem⁠
2 star anise⁠
dash of five spice powder⁠
750ml filtered water⁠
2 tbsp @nutraorganics Beef Bone Broth Concentrate⁠
⁠
Chicken -⁠
chicken breast or thigh⁠
1 tbsp soy sauce⁠
1 tbsp oyster sauce⁠
1 tbsp dark soy sauce⁠
1 minced garlic clove⁠
1 tsp raw sugar⁠
⁠
Toppings - ⁠
rice noodles (prepare as packet says)⁠
bean sprouts⁠
fried bok choy⁠
coriander⁠
mint⁠
spring onions⁠
⁠
METHOD:⁠
For the chicken I added all the sauces to the chicken and shook it in a bag, fried it in the pan to get a little char and then popped in he oven to cook through whilst I prepared the broth. ⁠
For the broth. Add the onion and ginger into a pot and fry (without any oil). Until you get some charring. Char = flavour baby. Then add the other aromatics; garlic, star anise, coriander stems, spring onion whites. Fry this for another 2 or so minutes. Then add in your filtered water and the star of the show... @nutraorganics Beef Bone Broth Concentrate. This packs soo much flavour, nutrients and yumminess to the broth. And gives the same taste of a 3 hour + slow cooked pho. Let this simmer for at least 15 or so minutes. Then assemble your soup with the cooked rice noodles, fresh herbs, bean sprouts, chicken, veg and ladle the yummy broth on top. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lime.⁠
So delicious. ⁠

nutra organics,"4 ways to tell you are getting high quality bone broth concentrate ✨⁠
⁠
Have you been thinking, ""oh broth-er, how the heck do I know I'm buying high quality bone broth concentrate?""⁠
⁠
Not to fear, here's a little checklist for you when choosing your broth so you can get concentrates nutrition for gut and immune support. ⁠
⁠
✨ Colour - the darker the colour of your bone broth, the higher the concentration of gelatin and collagen, the lighter colour can often be due to added or emulsified fat. Our broths contain less than 1% fat, which is why they are so rich in colour. We intentionally skim the fat from the surface during the slow cooking process, leaving a rich concentrate behind that is higher in collagen protein.

✨ Nutrition Panel - Are you buying a concentrate derived from bone marrow or tallow? The nutrition panel will give you the answer. Look for the amounts of actual protein and fat inside of our concentrates. If you are after concentrated nutrition from bone marrow, the protein values should be higher, while fat should be lower. ⁠

✨Taste - taste the difference. Does your concentrate taste like rich beef bone broth or does it have a fatty aftertaste?⁠

✨ Texture - The stickier and more solid the better. Why? It means that the product is rich in gelatinous material and it tends to stick together and form a glue.⁠

⁠
You may be asking, what's the difference between our new Bone Broth Concentrates and our original Beef Bone Broth powder that you know and love? Let us break it down for you! ⁠
⁠
Both our Concentrates and Powders have similar benefits for the immune system, gut wellbeing, and energy ⚡️ The differences come about in the flavour profile, format and usage. ⁠
⁠
Our Beef Bone Broth Concentrates have a rich flavour profile, so are great to add into soups, stews, gravies and cooking with a smaller amount needed. Meanwhile, our Beef Bone Broth Powders have a delicate flavour profile (super delicious to sip on in a cup of hot water).⁠
⁠
Finally, our Concentrates need to be refrigerated once opened and used within 4 weeks. Powders, on the other hand, are shelf-stable and better for travel! ⁠
⁠
So what's your pick? You can find your favourite broths via link in bio #nutraorganics",10-05-2023,0,,,0,244,28,https://www.instagram.com/p/CsDot1RsTeF/,

2 ingredient gut loving gummies! Recipe is from @boobtofood 🤍 I get lots of questions about what I feed Luca and this page has so many amazing posts full of information and ideas for your little loves (and yourselves!)⁠
⁠
The recipe -⁠
Ingredients⁠
+1 1/2 cups cold pressed juice or whatever liquid you want (coconut water, smoothie, etc). The 'thinner' the liquid (like juice) the firmer the gummies will set, but things like smoothies means the gummies will set more jelly-like⁠
+4 tbsp gelatin⁠
⁠
Method:⁠
1. add liquid to a saucepan and sprinkle over the gelatin⁠
2. wait a few minutes and allow the mixture to 'bloom', it will look wrinkly and thicken⁠
3. put the saucepan on a low heat and stir until the gelatin is dissolved (around 3 minutes)⁠
4. pour into moulds of choice⁠
5. put in the fridge until set. When I give them to Luca, I cut them up⁠

⁠
That 3 pm energy crash is something I hear about daily in clinic with clients and we have all been there 🙋‍♀️.⁠
Usually we are reaching for sugar to keep that energy momentum going until work is done and the brain fog has been temporarily lifted.⁠
⁠
When I’m teaching my clients about balanced blood sugar regulation throughout the day, snacking and meals play an important role in the sustained energy response especially when it comes to the afternoon slump so many people feel.⁠
⁠
I created this smoothie to support that slump and ensure it’s a nutrient dense option packed with protein, fats and unrefined carbohydrates.⁠
This is your new go to when that 3pm crash occurs.⁠
⁠
I have used @nutraorganics Collagen Beauty for its bioactive collagen peptides (protein) and the Organic Peruvian Maca powder for its nutty/caramel flavour - delicious 🤤⁠
Maca has been traditionally used for centuries to support vitality.⁠
⁠
Ingredients:⁠
Frozen or unfrozen small banana⁠
1 tablespoon of Collagen Beauty⁠
1 tablespoon of Organic Peruvian Maca⁠
3 frozen spinach cubes⁠
A handful of fresh mint⁠
1 tablespoon of cashew butter⁠
Coconut milk for the liquid base.⁠
Blend all ingredients.⁠
⁠
The cashew butter and Maca work beautifully together for a creamy nutty flavour. This smoothie is high in essential fatty acids, antioxidants, protein, carbohydrates and micronutrients to keep you energized for the rest of the day.⁠

⁠
Not all nutrients were created equal, some were created by nature over billions of years to achieve the perfect chemical balance for life, and others were artificially synthesised in a lab. Here at Nutra, we will continue to choose wholefoods over synthetics every time, and here’s some pretty great reasons why: ⁠
⁠
🍓 Bioavailability - Studies have continually found that natural nutrients are absorbed better and are more bioavailable than their synthetic counterparts⁠
🥬 Easier on your body - Synthetic vitamins put additional strain on our bodies as they often require biological activation once they are consumed. Natural vitamins, on the other hand, are biologically active and are present alongside other natural compounds that will enhance their action.⁠
🍅 More effective at lower doses - Because natural nutrients are absorbed and activated at a higher ratio than synthetic ones, you don’t need to consume as much for your body to get the benefits.⁠
🥦 Consuming nutrients the way nature intended is always safer.⁠
🫐 Family friendly - Vitamins from wholefoods are family-friendly and safe for children, pregnant and breastfeeding women. ⁠

Warm quinoa, pumpkin and chickpea salad featuring @nutraorganics beef bone broth - adaptogenic mushrooms.⁠
⁠
I love this salad as it’s nourishing for the soul and you will have plenty of leftovers for a few lunches.⁠
⁠
What you need:⁠
⁠
1 cup of quinoa rinsed⁠
1 can of chickpeas rinsed⁠
1 1/2 tablespoons of beef bone broth @nutraorganics - mushroom flavour⁠
1/4 pumpkin sliced into wedges⁠
1 cup of salad mix⁠
1/2 an avocado⁠
1-2 tsp of cumin⁠
Olive oil to drizzle⁠
1/2 a lemon⁠
1/2 a zucchini spiraled⁠
Salt and pepper to taste⁠
⁠
Method:⁠
Preheat oven to 180.⁠
Chop the pumpkin into wedges after removing the seeds - leave the skin on.⁠
Rinse chickpeas and combine pumpkin and chickpeas on a roasting dish with cumin, salt, pepper and olive oil. Toss to combine.⁠
Place in the oven and cook until nice and roasted - usually around 30 mins - depending on your oven and the thickness of your pumpkin.⁠
⁠
While the pumpkin is roasting - cook 1 cup of quinoa per packet instructions with 1 1/2 tablespoons of beef bone broth added to the water. This creates a stock to cook the quinoa in.⁠
⁠
While the quinoa is cooking, wash salad ingredients and spiral the zucchini or use a grater to grate long strips of zucchini noodles. Peel 1/2 an avocado.⁠
⁠
Once everything is cooked and cooled a little - build your warm salad bowl anyway you like. I have drizzled mine with tahini, olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon - salt and pepper to taste. 😍⁠
⁠
I love the @nutraorganics bone broth as it gives the quinoa an incredible flavour with boosting the nutrient content at the same time.⁠
⁠
I love the adaptogenic mushroom beef bone broth as it supports the immune system during these cold winter months. It’s also high in B group vitamins, zinc, vitamin D and collagen.⁠

We see you pouring love into the lives of those lucky enough to call you mum. ⁠
⁠
We see you rocking, kissing, nourishing, and holding those around you with a grace that you probably can't see yourself. ⁠
⁠
You were warned about those blissful and blurry newborn days, when this new little life would need every part of you, but what they didn't tell you about was what happens once that hazey newborn bubble lifts. ⁠
⁠
When you're needed in different ways. When it can be so easy to continue to give your everything to nurturing this special little life that you helped to create at the detriment of nurturing yourself.⁠
⁠
While the days with our little ones are so fleeting, it's still important to find the rituals that bring us back to ourselves. A cup of coffee in the morning sun, a walk in nature, a meal made with love to nourish you as well as your family. These little acts of self-love help us to be the best for not only our children but for ourselves. ⁠
⁠
And what could be more important than setting an example to our children that taking care of ourselves is important? ⁠
⁠
So when it's all too overwhelming, and you feel like you've got nothing left to give, step outside, take that breath and a moment to yourself, remind yourself that you are an incredible mother, and show yourself the same amount of grace that you show your toddler who's throwing a tantrum because you told them not to eat the dog's food.⁠

We suggest mixing your Captain Calm with full cream cow’s milk or soy milk not only because it’s delicious, but more importantly, for the added benefits of tryptophan. The body uses tryptophan as part of the process of making melatonin and serotonin. Melatonin helps regulate sleep cycles, and serotonin has been known to regulate sleep and moods.

nutra organics,"We get it, with so many options out there it can be hard to know what to look for when choosing a collagen powder. So we've broken it down for you (you're welcome 😉) Here are our top three things to look for in quality collagen⁠
⁠
⭐️ Scientifically Researched Collagen Peptides⁠
Look for specific collagen peptides that have been scientifically researched! For example, VERISOL® has been broken down in such a way that it specifically targets skin hair and nails. ⁠
⁠
⭐️ Complimentary nutrients⁠
Taking collagen is great but you also need to ensure that your body is well equipped with other nutrients to ensure you get the most out of your collagen. Our collagens contain supportive nutrients like vitamin C & zinc to boost your collagen production.⁠
⁠
⭐️ Potency⁠
Check the ingredients list and nutrition information panel to make sure the product actually contains plenty of collagen. Just because it says collagen on the front, doesn’t mean that's the main ingredient.⁠

We know how it goes, with the best of intentions, you pick up an attractive looking skin care tester and turn it over to check the ingredients list. You’re an intelligent, conscious consumer who cares about what chemicals go on your skin. But, as you scan the ingredient list, you realise that there is only about one word that you actually recognise (Aqua - well done!) but the rest is just a blur of numbers and letters and you actually have no idea what you are looking at. So you turn the product back over, pop a bit of cream on the back of your hand, rub it in, smell it and put it back on the shelf. Don’t feel bad, we have all been there.

You probably know by now that broth is seriously good for you. We're here to dissect the morning cup of broth craze that celebrities like Goop queen Gwyneth Paltrow, Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner swear by.

💫 Glutamine, proline & glycine is soothing for your gut, setting your digestion up for a great day ahead
💫 Energy before a workout, no coffee crashes here
💫 Speeding up the recovery process of muscles and bones

We love hearing your feedback about broths, here’s some tips to look out for when you’re next stocking up on broth:

🥣 make sure it’s low sodium - one serve of our Beef Bone Broth contains half the amount of sodium in comparison with broth concentrates available on the market.
🥣 make sure nutrients and taste are preserved - our broths undergo a unique cooking method and then are gently refractance dried to retain maximum nutrients, taste, and colour, this is why they sparkle ✨
🥣easy to use, anywhere & anytime - our broth is ready in seconds, as tasty and nutritious as homemade and easy to take on the go.
🥣 check the nutrition panel - due to our unique formulations we have naturally occurring vitamins and minerals that have been measured on the nutrition panel (we prove what we claim)

nutra organics,"Nothing fishy about this one ya’ll, oh except the salmon, you could say that’s pretty fishy. It’s no secret that fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have an array of health benefits such as being cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and mood boosting. 💫

So what is the link between fatty acids and our mood? We’re calling this the “food mood flow”. 🙌🏻

Studies show that dietary fatty acids stimulate the production of dopamine in our brain, also known as the ""happy hormone"". Unlike dopamine, gut bacteria manufacture about 90 percent of the body's serotonin, positively influencing both mood and gastrointestinal health. What better reason to add this recipe to your weekly repertoire, paired here with fennel, lemon and mint to further help aid digestion.

This quick and healthy nourishing salad is not only a rich source of protein, antioxidants and minerals but also contains heart-healthy mono-unsaturated fats to aid digestion, support glowing skin and support those feel good hormones.

nutra organics,"Immunity becomes a hot topic in winter as things cool down, shorter daylight hours and cooler temperatures can leave us more vulnerable to infection and illness so we wanted to share some insight into what your body needs to stay pathogen-fighting fit ✨⁠
⁠
To help keep you healthy, here are some diet and lifestyle tips for keeping your immune system in top working order:⁠
⁠
⭐️ Energy and Nutrients – Some of the most essential nutrients to support immune function are: ⁠
Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin D! Our best way of getting Vitamin D is from the sun, but we can’t always get enough sun. This is why our Mushroom Broths, available in Beef, Chicken and Vegetable, are so good for the immune system (especially in Winter), as they contain a high Vitamin D Mushroom Powder. But as always, a healthy varied diet is always your best bet to ensure you are covering all bases and supporting your body!⁠
⁠
⭐️ Exercise – Exercise stimulates a heap of processes in the body to help with health and vitality, but one of the specific benefits of exercise for immunity is the boost in circulation and lymph drainage. White Blood Cells and Phagocytes are moved around in lymph fluid and blood. They destroy bacteria and other small foreign cells. The boost in circulation can speed this process up! ⁠
⁠
⭐️ Sleep – Sleep is an extremely important component of immunity. A lack of sleep has been shown to reduce the number and activity of immune cells which can lead to an increased risk of illness. ⁠
⁠
⭐️ Pre and Probiotics – A happy balanced microbiome is an important ally in immunity as it helps to prevent the growth of harmful disease-causing pathogens. ⁠
⁠
In conclusion, as per most self-care pieces of advice, mum was right all along. Feed yourself well, move well and rest well to stay well this winter #nutraorganics",10-05-2022,0,,,0,91,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CdXx-A0MoMq/,

nutra organics,"Looking after your hormones and caring for your follicular cycle has never been so easy and crunchalicious with this gorgeous granola as a seed cycling breakfast.💗 What is seed cycling you ask? Seed cycling is a food as medicine practice common among alternative health practitioners to promote a rhythmic monthly cycle. This method supports hormonal balance by rotating blends of seeds specific to the two phases of the menstrual cycle, the follicular and luteal phase.

The follicular phase is the first phase of the menstrual cycle, starting on the first day of menstruation and lasting around 14 days. During this phase a woman's body is busy preparing for the release of an egg at ovulation which is stimulated by rising follicle stimulating hormone, estrogen and luteinizing hormone. Balancing estrogen levels has a flow on effect with luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormones due to clever hormone feedback loops. ✨

Salted Caramel Granola for your follicular cycle is a very natural, easy and inexpensive way to incorporate a food as medicine approach to support your cycle.  Our Salted Caramel Clean Protein and Organic Perviuan Maca have been used to up the yums and boost the hormone love 🌼

We decided it was time to try and put words to the complete devastation, heartbreak and trauma, but also the goodness we've witnessed firsthand on the ground covered in mud, sweat and tears as we help in rebuilding our community and will continue to do so for as long as it takes! 🙏🏻
​
On the 27th February 2022, thousands of people fled their homes as the waters started to rise. Although the floods ripped through our town of Murwillumbah and the towns of the Northern Rivers, leaving behind absolute devastation, the flood of love and the kindness of the community has been as refreshing as clear blue skies. 🌞
​
​Civilians created funds for helicopters, boat rescues, food and water drop off locations and clean up coordination. Were it not for the power of the people, so many of those alive and safe today might have had a completely different story. The waters rose, but the community and kindness has risen higher still! 💛
​
While there may still be a long road ahead to rebuild our town, businesses and houses, the road to recovery has been paved with an undeniable strength of togetherness, these are the things that are the difference between a house and a home, a town and a community. It's never been more evident how important supporting local and getting to know your community where you are is. When the hard times come, these people will be the shoulder you lean on and the hand that helps you back up. ✨

A few months ago, we asked you what a 'fit body' looks like, and a few other questions surrounding fitness and body image. We were moved by the thousands of responses we received. 9/10 women said they feel body conscious walking into a gym, and 8/10 women said their Instagram feed makes them feel insecure & self conscious.

We are speaking up and helping to break the stereotype of what a ‘fit body’ looks and feels like. Let’s start the conversation & take some action!
We didn’t wake up feeling this way. The stereotypical ‘fit body’ has been perpetually reinforced to us through social discourse until it became a learned behaviour that we’ve over time accepted and adopted as the norm. Let’s take some control back. Let’s unlearn these behaviours and do our bit to make sure every body form feels represented and understood in the media and a social context.

""This is my ultimate fast food and we enjoy it for dinner once a week. It's a fantastic way to incorporate bone broth into your diet as the weather warms up. The vegetables are finely shredded and left raw, with the hot broth gently warming them through whilst leaving them nice and crunchy. I love it because you can use any vegetables you have on hand. In my home this recipe changes with the seasons and depends on what vegetables are in my garden or what's in my fridge. In the cooler months I like to infuse the bone broth with spices like star anise and cinnamon, or even add a spoonful of curry paste and splash of coconut cream and fish sauce. Occasionally I'll add 1/4 cup rice per person to the bone broth as it is simmering instead of noodles and I often add a soft boiled egg or shredded chicken. I hope you enjoy this seasonal broth!"" - love Cass X #nutraorganics

The next four images are a pale pink background with emoji like small images next to a kitchen hack. The kitchen hacks read: 
1. Place your fresh herbs (except for basil) in a glass of water in the fridge to keep them fresher for longer 

2. Make a clean-out-your-fridge dish once a week to reduce wastage - stir fries & soups are a great option 

3. Reuse old jars as storage for your nuts, seeds & grains

4. Cut your avocados around the middle rather than length ways, to avoid less surface area becoming brown

5. Add a raisin to your flat champagne bottle to reignite some bubbles

6. Cracked egg? Add vinegar to your pot before you boil to prevent a leak

7. Add your garlic cloves to a container and shake to remove the skin

8. Freeze your herbs in ice trays with oil for easy use when cooking dishes that need heat

9. Put your hard avocados next to your bananas to ripen them up

10. For lemon juice, pearce the lemon through the side (length wise) with a skewer and squeeze

11. Plant the seeds from your veggies in your veggie patch

12. Difficulty opening a fresh jar? Put it upside down in a bowl of warm water for 20 seconds to loosen it

13. Stale bread? Don’t throw it away. Use it to make yummy croutons for your next caesar salad

14. Organise your pantry condiments into categorised baskets 

15. Give your plants a nice drink with banana water. Add old peels to water for two days, then water your plants

16. Kept on their own in a cool location, cucumbers will last longer when not refrigerated.]",06-12-2021,0,,,0,255,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CXIkUiOhVGS/,

It's the first of its kind on the post sun exposure market to contain proven Sol-C Micro Collagen Peptides, which improve hydration, barrier function and collagen synthesis. Too much sun not only leaves us rosey coloured and tired, it can also come with a higher chance of nasty skin conditions. Aside from skin damage, excess sun exposure also breaks down collagen at a much faster rate than normal, how rude. It’s why we made sure to add micro collagen molecules, which absorb into the epidermis and create a film on the skin’s surface, along with Vitamin C, which helps to support collagen production and prevent pigmentation.

​
​""Why I’m so excited about @nutraorganics new blends of antioxidant rich powders. 👇
I’m going to highlight my two favourites because these are going to be wonderful for all my pregnant and breastfeeding mummas.

The acai berry blend and the super greens+reds blend.

These powders are completely fine for pregnancy and breastfeeding and contain a myriad of carefully selected ingredients to support immunity, energy, gut health and are high in antioxidants.

It can be extremely difficult in the first trimester of pregnancy to eat any vegetables. I suffered from morning sickness and only ate toasted cheese sandwiches, pickles and salty potato chips. I did however, crave cold fruit.

These powders are fantastic to blend together and freeze with coconut water to create an icypole that tastes great, easy to consume through pregnancy and has the added benefits of providing the body with an abundance of nutrients that may be hard to consume.

I support many women in clinic who struggle to eat vegetables during pregnancy and I want you to know you are not alone. That’s why I’m thrilled I can recommend these products to you all for nutrient support through pregnancy and postpartum. These products contain no synthetic ingredients and use wholefoods to make these superior powders.""

Collagen Balm is the perfect restorative ointment for intervention whilst helping to maintain youthful looking skin around the mouth.

On top of it being the season of chapped lips, the repeated use of mask wearing we’ve been experiencing this year can also create friction points on the skin around the mouth and nose, whilst increasing moisture and bacteria in these areas. Applying a topical barrier protector such as Collagen Balm before the use of a mask can help to prevent irritated skin.

Collagen Balm can also support the treatment of new stretch marks when applied at least twice daily (morning and night) to the affected area to keep skin supple, making it perfect for pregnant women.

nutra organics,"While some canisters appear to be made out of a type of paperboard and may look and feel recyclable, many are coated in a thin protective laminate that make it feel more 'luxe,' but because the laminate is a form of plastic, it makes it a single use item. This is because the laminate can't be separated from the paperboard that it's been adhered to.

We are proud to be leading the way in sustainable packaging within our industry. Our products are available in canisters that are fully recyclable, are less carbon intensive than steel cans & glass, and the paper used is made from 100% recyclable fiber. When diverted to the recycling stream, the canisters have a recovery rate of 88%. 

We also use a water based adhesive, which makes our canisters far more recyclable than those that use an oil base adhesive. This is because canisters with oil based adhesive cannot be passed through the Smelter and be burned down to a recyclable form - meaning it often ends up as landfill.

With over 168,000 votes cast in the Nourished Life Awards, Collagen Beauty™ has come out on top as the best ingestible collagen. Going up against major market leaders, Collagen Beauty™ advocates stood behind the scientifically backed formulation and its effectiveness in reversing the signs of skin ageing in just eight weeks of use.⁣
⁣
Collagen Beauty™ delivers targeted results by supporting new collagen production thanks to the Verisol® collagen peptides included in the innovative formulation, which help to reduce wrinkles, smooth fine lines and support healthy hair and nails.⁣
⁣
Along with the unique collagen peptides, the other dynamic ingredient contained in Collagen Beauty™ is Vitamin C. The two make a powerful duo because collagen formulation in the body can’t happen without Vitamin C - which may come as a surprise given lots of collagens on the market don’t contain the complementary ingredient.⁣

nutra organics,"Join Us On The Journey. 🌾⁣
For some time now we have been working towards becoming a more sustainable company. As part of this initiative, we have actively been reducing our use of plastic wherever we can.⁣
⁣
This plastic-free July we want to celebrate how far we’ve come, and also acknowledge our ongoing commitment to do more. Reducing the use of plastic can be a difficult task, particularly when there are large-scale supply chains involved. We recognise that we are not perfect, but we are proud to say we are doing our best and we will always look for ways to improve.⁣
⁣
Some of the changes we’ve implemented over the past few years include changing from plastic recyclable tubs to 100% plastic-free recyclable canisters and removing all unnecessary plastic (scoops, order wrapping) from our products.⁣
⁣
Join us on the journey this Plastic Free July. It doesn’t have to be perfect - but every bit counts. We should all feel empowered to make little changes wherever we can to reduce our use of plastic. What changes will you be making this month?⁣

The clinical studies on the collagen peptides we use in Collagen Beauty and Glow Mist were conducted on a group of women mostly over 50. The youngest participant in the studies was 35.⁣

The results? The more each participants' skin, hair and nails had aged, the more dramatic the difference that the collagen peptides made in terms of skin hydration & elasticity, reduction of wrinkles, and hair and nail health.⁣

nutra organics,"NEW CLEAN GREENS 🥬 Launching Feb 3 💫 An alkalising blend of the purest, certified organic, straight up greens to support optimal wellbeing.⁣
⁣
Containing the 8 most powerful super greens plus marine minerals, Clean Greens is a pure wholefood source of magnesium, calcium, potassium, vitamins A and B12. This supports the acid-alkaline balance in your body, protects your immune system, promotes energy, supports digestion, balances electrolytes and supports muscle and nerve function.⁣
⁣
Why take greens if you work out? 🌿 Living an active lifestyle and consuming a lot of protein to support fitness goals can cause a buildup of acid residue within the body - so Clean Greens helps to maintain the all important acid-alkaline balance - helping you to feel vibrant, energised and well.⁣
⁣
What’s different about the improved formulations?⁣
✨ We’ve added three new powerhouse ingredients - E3AFA Aquabotanical Algae, Blue Spirulina and Aquamin Marine Minerals⁣
✨ E3AFA (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) is an algae from pristine lake Klamath USA, considered by world renowned health authorities to be nature's most beneficial superfood. Clean Greens is the only Australian greens powder to contain this ingredient.⁣
✨ Clean Greens is now the most alkalising formulation in Australia, with a PRAL (potential renal acid load) value of -100. By comparison, kale has a PRAL value of -11, making Clean Greens nearly 9x more alkalising per 100g.⁣
✨ With 68% Australian ingredients, Clean Greens has a higher percentage of Australian ingredients compared to other greens powders on the market. Ingredients such as Matcha from Japan, E3AFA from USA and Aquamin Marine Minerals from Iceland are not grown in Australia.⁣
⁣
There’s no flavours or fillers added to Clean Greens - only a touch of stevia to help balance the bitterness. Just pure, straight up, superior quality greens. Mix with your Clean Protein, Clean Energy or into a smoothie. Or if you’re hardcore, straight in a glass of water.⁣

nutra organics,"5 ways you can reduce stress & support your immune system 💫 I think we can all admit that the year 2020 has been a tad stressful. Even if you don't personally feel too inconvenienced by COVID-19, the collective aura of uncertainty as we trench through a pandemic is enough to get our nervous system firing a little more than usual.⁣
⁣
Luckily we are resilient beings and for the most part, as long as we get enough sleep, drink enough water and take a little time out for ourselves, we can bounce back brighter and better than ever quite quickly after going through a stressful patch. Where the problem lies is if this stressful patch becomes a stressful football field.⁣
⁣
While the pandemic lives on and supporting our immune system over the long haul becomes more and more of a priority, it's growing increasingly important to understand the delicate dance between the stress we will inadvertently come in into contact with and how we can best support our health overall so our immune system stays working at its optimum.⁣
⁣
Our Naturopath Eliza has shared the 5 most important things you can do to reduce stress and support your immune system over on our blog. Head to our link in bio to read ✨ #nutraorganics",17-12-2020,0,,,0,181,2,https://www.instagram.com/p/CI5DF_-HvaR/,

Salmon is amazing for skin because of the high omega-3 content, which is protective and anti-inflammatory for skin. Broccoli provides more than just a serve of greens, it’s most studied antioxidant is a chemical called sulphoraphane, which has a huge number of health benefits, but has also been shown to improve oxygenation of the skin, promote hair and nail growth and assist the body with its natural detoxification processes. We’ve also chosen to use Brown Rice as the base of our bowl as it’s rich in B Vitamins and Selenium (which is great for healthy hair and nails). We’ve topped our nourish bowl with a bright and zesty orange ginger dressing, which comes with its own beauty benefits. Orange contains vitamin C to protect against free radical damage and assist in collagen production. Olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats, essential polyunsaturated fats omega 3 and 6 and antioxidants. Olive oil supports skin barrier function, and is anti inflammatory. Ginger & garlic contain powerful anti inflammatory properties as well as great flavour.

nutra organics,"GLOW MIST ✨ Proven ingredients to protect collagen & plump skin, for all skin types.⁣
⁣
Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated our unique Sol-C™ micro collagen peptides significantly improve hydration, barrier function and increase collagen synthesis. The powerhouse peptides get to work by both absorbing into the epidermis and forming a protective barrier on the skin’s surface, creating a plumper and smoother complexion.⁣
⁣
Over 75% of our skin is made up of collagen, which begins to degenerate in our mid-twenties and is accelerated by other lifestyle and environmental factors, such as the sun and air pollution. The Sol-C™ collagen peptides & Vitamin C in Glow Mist provide antioxidant protection to prevent collagen damage from the environment, whilst regenerating new collagen formation. Plus, with hyaluronic acid, which holds 1000x its weight in water within the cells of skin, Glow Mist is deeply hydrating and keeps skin plump and juicy.⁣

I have forever struggled with brittle nails that I bite and pick. Within two weeks of using this product my nails were a different story. They grow like crazy, I actually have to cut them every week, they are strong and do not chip or break which means I don’t pick or bite them anymore. I finally have nice nails that I’m not ashamed of! As for my hands, I always had dry skin on my hands, and patches of some sort of dermatitis that no cream recommended by doctors would fix. Again within two weeks of taking this I no longer had these extreme dry, red and itchy patches on my hands! Absolutely amazing! I’m onto my second tub if it and i never want to run out of this product! Thank you x""⁣

nutra organics,"Why you need Zinc for glowing skin 💫 If you’re not familiar with the skin loving benefits of Zinc, welcome to your crash course. Bioavailable Zinc (from organic guava) is one of the powerful ingredients in Collagen Beauty, and is essential for improving skin, hair and nails. Here’s why:⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
✨ Zinc is a cofactor for skin, hair and nail structural development, it does this by developing and maintaining the protein component fundamental to structure of skin, hair and nails⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
✨ Zinc supports wound healing, and helps to minimise long term scarring damage caused by acne and other skin wounds.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
✨ Zinc supports the action of antioxidants (like vitamin c), which is important for fighting the free radical damage that accelerates the skin ageing process.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
✨ Aside from beauty benefits, Zinc is also required for supporting your immune system.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Our source of Zinc from organic Guava is far more bioavailable than synthetic sources of Zinc which aren’t as easily absorbed by your body. This means you’ll experience much better results for supporting skin structure, wound healing and antioxidant protection - and is one of the many reasons why Collagen Beauty is the best for turning up your natural glow.⁣

nutra organics,"Better results with Collagen Beauty ✨ With so many collagens out there, it can be confusing knowing which one is the best for you. Here's 5 reasons why Collagen Beauty is the most effective for skin, hair, nails and gut health:⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
1. We use the only scientifically researched bioactive collagen peptides, VERISOL®, that have been shown in multiple studies to reduce skin wrinkles, improve skin hydration and elasticity, and improve hair strength and thickness.⁣⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
2. We've included bioavailable organic wholefood sources of Vitamin C, Zinc plus the herb Horsetail to further support collagen production and healthy hair, nails & gut wellbeing.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
3. We include a generous amount of hydrolysed collagen in every serve - 10g in the unflavoured Collagen Beauty and 7.5g in Collagen Beauty flavours. This ensures there are plenty of the key amino acids (collagen building blocks) available to create the new collagen in your skin. Most other brands have 3g or less per serve - and whilst small doses of collagen might tell the body to try to increase internal collagen production, it won't provide the necessary foundations required to actually build the new collagen. With more collagen per serve in Collagen Beauty, you'll experience better results much faster.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
4. We don't use any fillers, additives or artificial ingredients. Pure, potent, proven ingredients for superior results only, plus Collagen Beauty is pregnancy and breastfeeding friendly and suitable for kids 12 months and up.⁣
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
5. Convenient. Our unflavoured Collagen Beauty is perfect to mix into any drinks or food, and our three natural Collagen Beauty flavours are delicious straight on water.⁣

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Social injustice towards BIPOC is heartbreaking, and we are deeply saddened by what has happened in the US.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We are equally saddened that this same injustice is so prevalent yet so silenced within our own country towards Indigenous Australians, the traditional owners of our land.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So we are taking a stand, reflecting on ways we can be a meaningful part of the change, and are making these long term commitments to do better:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1/ Amplify black voices. We will be more mindful, inclusive and partner with more diverse BIPOC content creators.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2/ Partner with charities through our next Project Give Back initiative that support Indigenous Australians. (Read more about Project Give Back on our website).
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3/ Educate ourselves more and share information to stand against racism and social injustice. This week we are muting our usual content, and will instead support our BIPOC community and stand with them.

The antioxidants and Vitamin C together are powerful immune boosters, and also assist in collagen formation and protecting skin from the damaging affects of free radicals.

🌽Ingredients🌽
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
4 corn cobs
1-1.5kg of chicken thighs
1 leek (just the light part thinly sliced)
4 whole garlic cloves squished
2L of chicken stock or @nutraorganics chicken bone broth
5 leaves of silver beet chopped (spinach or kale works perfectly too!)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🌽Method🌽
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Using a sharp knife, cut down the side of the corn cobs to remove the corn. Pop the loose corn along with the left over cobs into your slow cooker along with your whole chicken thighs, leek and garlic cloves. Add your chicken stock, I used @nutraorganics chicken bone broth to give my soup a kick of immunity boosting goodness. Top it up with enough water to make sure the chicken is covered. Cook for 6-7 hours on low (or 3-4 hours on high), you want the chicken to be falling apart 🤤
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Once the chicken is falling apart put it into a separate bowl and shred it with a fork.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Remove your corn cobs, and put half your soup mix into a blender and blitz until smooth (make sure it has cooled before you blitz it!).
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Put the shredded chicken back into the slow cooker along with your soup mix, add your chopped silver beet and cook on high for about 10 minutes or until wilted.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Season with salt and pepper and serve up with some delicious buttery toast for a warming nutritious winter meal the whole family will love 💚""",01-06-2020,0,,,0,573,15,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA4vxyGnUGh/,

The premium Japanese Matcha and energising herbs in our Matcha Latte really put a pep in our step on a cool morning. Traditionally, you would make Horchata by soaking rice grains, but we’re not that awake of a morning, so we’ve used a Coconut-Rice Milk blend instead, meaning we get to enjoy this cup of sunshine that much sooner!

nutra organics,"""BONE BROTH and why it’s my absolute GO TO not only in the current health crisis but for preventative health. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Majority of you already know I’m a HUGE fan of bone broths for GUT health and the reason why is because 85% of our immune cells reside in the gut. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE GUT ARE BESTIES.
Simple and easy to understand for you.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Bone broth contains a myriad of health benefits:
Supports the gut mucosal membrane barrier (the gut wall).
Helps decrease intestinal permeability (leaky gut).
Decreases inflammation in the gut due to many antioxidant properties and essential amino acids.
It’s full of glutamine, collagen and gelatin - helps rebuild the tissue of the gut.
Helps promote serotonin production (our happy neurotransmitter)
Increases the production of secretory IgA which helps stop the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria in the gut and supports the immune system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
All of this supports a healthy functioning immune system. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I use @nutraorganics because it’s user friendly and can be added to cooking or consumed as a savoury tea. They have a huge range of different flavours and vegan options also.""

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
✨ Matcha contains a fifth of the amount of caffeine as a standard cup of coffee, but also contains the amino acid L-Theanine for calm energy release (goodbye caffeine crash)
✨ Matcha is rich in unique antioxidants (catechins) that are found exclusively in green tea, which are important for protection against free radicals
✨ Our blend also contains traditional adaptogenic mushrooms Lion's Mane and Cordyceps and Coconut MCT oil to further the awakening benefits of matcha and help with focus and clarity

The Aztec ruler Montezuma consumed up to 50 cups of hot cacoa before a saucy night out, and legendary lover Casanova touted chocolate’s powerful aphrodisiac qualities.
⠀
Organic Maca ♡ A root that has been traditionally used as an aphrodisiac and to enhance energy and libido. The three varieties of Maca (black, red and yellow) are each traditionally associated with supporting masculine, feminine or both sexual energies. We have used a combination of all three Maca’s to make sure there is something in there for everyone.
⠀
Damiana ♡ A native american shrub, and is another aphrodisiac herb with a long history of use by ancient aztecs for enhancing energy and boosting libido.
⠀
Horny Goat Weed ♡ A traditional Chinese herb used for improving sexual function and boosting libido in both males and females. It’s suggestive name comes folk observations that goats who grazed the herb would become unusually sexually active.
⠀
Organic Tribulus ♡ An ayurvedic herb, traditionally used to improve sexual desire and function, and more recently, several placebo controlled studies have shown its positive effects for increasing arousal, desire, lubrication and overall satisfaction.
⠀
Coconut MCT oil ♡ A readily available energy source for the central nervous system, and as an instant source of energy for the brain, can have a positive association with improving mood and cognitive function.
⠀
Monk Fruit ♡ A Chinese fruit that is naturally intensely sweet, approximately 8 times sweeter than sugar, and and contains next to no sugar or calories. We haven't added any sugar into Lover's Latte, and it's only naturally sweetened with a little Monk Fruit.

We definitely believe in all things in moderation here at Nutra Organics, but given that it’s Christmas and moderation goes out the window on Christmas, we thought that it would be best to exclude the cured meats from this years spread in favour of this healthier, lower salt and preservative free option.

Collagen Beauty™ and Mermaid Latte™ sachets are now available on our website to purchase in their new sustainable packaging, and our other sachet products will be making the switch early 2020. All of our bars are now in 100% home compostable wrappers too! 🌿
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The sachets are completely plant based, predominantly from sustainably harvested eucalyptus trees. For every tree harvested, another tree is planted. These sachets will break down within 26 weeks once disposed in a compostable environment, leaving no traces of eco toxins in the soil. Worms love eating the sachets just as much as you will enjoy what’s inside!

All too often when a crowd of family and friends are gathered together, so many dietary requirements can make creating a Christmas menu tricky. With this in mind, we put together a collection of colourful, fun and festive share plate style recipes with plenty of options that cater to just about everyone - vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, gluten and dairy intolerant individuals and everything in between.

The one thing all recipes have in common is that they are made from pure wholefoods, are (almost) completely clean and free from any nasties, and are a jolly good time!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We include clean festive cocktails in our recipes because: A) they’re delicious, B) they’re mostly clean, spiked with nutrition, and are a more wholesome alternative to most cocktail recipes you can find, C) why the heck not, it's holiday time! Let’s celebrate with a cocktail or two and cheers in Christmas and New Years! 🥂

nutra organics,"Grain free matcha latte brownies via our fave foodie @panaceas_pantry 🍵😋. ""I used the new adaptogenic matcha latte powder from @nutraorganics (a beautiful blend of premium Japanese matcha, MCT oil and adaptogenic mushrooms) to create these, and they are so delicious.""
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Brownie Recipe:
Black sesame brownie with matcha frosting (grain free, GF, vegan). .
2 Tbsp flax seeds, ground
90 mL water
1 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 cup cacao powder
1/2 tsp good-quality salt
2 tsp baking powder
1 cup coconut sugar
1/2 cup black tahini
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1 cup ＋ 1 Tbsp almond milk
100g vegan dark chocolate, chopped
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Method
1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees C. Line a 20cm square brownie tin, set aside.
2. Make flax eggs by combining flax with water. Mix well, and set aside for 10 mins to thicken. Melt chocolate and coconut oil in a heat proof bowl, over a pot of simmering water. Once melted, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Mix all dry ingredients (flour, cacao, salt, baking powder) in a large mixing bowl.
4. Add flax eggs, sugar and milk to the dry mix bowl, and combine until it just comes together. Add melted chocolate, then gently fold through, until uniform. Transfer to the baking tin and bake for 28-32 mins (I do 30). Allow to cool partially in tin, then turn onto a cooling rack to cool completely. .
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Adaptogenic matcha frosting:
1 cup cashews, soaked 4 hours
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 1/2 Tbsp @nutraorganics matcha latte powder .
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. Mix everything in a bowl until uniform. Place cooled brownie back intin, then put frosting on top. Bang on the bench to smooth, then set in the fridge. Once frosting is turned up, cut into desired servings, and store in an air-right container in the fridge.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Collagen Beauty™ is still the exact same formula you know and love - nothing inside the tub has changed at all.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We've also added the word 'gut' back onto the front, because although the bioactive collagen peptides Verisol® in Collagen Beauty™ specifically target collagen regeneration in skin, hair and nails, there is also a great serving of hydrolysed collagen types 1 and 3 and a wholefood source of Vitamin C which are beneficial for supporting gut health. Many of our customers love Collagen Beauty for the way it helps them feel inside as well as on the outside, so we have added this incredible benefit of Collagen Beauty™ back onto the front of the label.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Keira left us this review just this week: ""I do not supplement much of my diet but couldn't speak more highly of the collagen beauty. The improvement in my skin, hair & gut is beyond words.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We are so proud to announce that not only are all of our bars now available in 100% home compostable wrappers, but we have also completely stopped producing single use sachets too! It has been an incredibly challenging year, testing so many different sustainable sachets using only plant based materials, glues and inks, to find something that actually works. But we've finally done it, and starting from next month, all future productions of our sachet products will also be in 100% home compostable sachets 🙌

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Chia seeds are nutritious powerhouses as they are a great source of brain-healthy omega-3s, contain plenty of fibre, protein, fat, calcium, manganese, magnesium and phosphorus. Matcha contains a mild amount of naturally occurring caffeine (about one fifth of the amount of a standard cup of coffee per serve), and also contains the amino acid L-Theanine which helps to release energy in a more balanced way. So no quick energy spike, followed by a crash!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We have paired these two brain boosting foods with delicious fruits to ensure a good range of micronutrients. Feel free to use your own favourite fruit combinations, but we think the ones we have chosen really compliment the creamy, delicate, and softly sweet taste of our Matcha Latte.

nutra organics,"Plant Pad Thai 🌿✨ Pad Thai is a fresh favourite that is perfect over the Summer months. Normally with Pad Thai, all ingredients are combined together but we have styled this dish with the vegetables separate to the protein and the noodles so you can ensure you are getting a really good ratio of veggies. It’s a pretty good rule to apply to most of your meals that at least half the plate should be taken up with vegetables! This ensures a huge variety of nutrients, plenty of fibre and means you can eat a lot of food without overdoing the energy intake.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You can use whatever veggies you like for this dish, so you can keep reinventing it and make it year-round. The combination of noodles, tofu, peanuts and vegetables makes this a great mix of all of your macronutrients, so it will fill you up and keep you satisfied for a good few hours!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Our team has poured their heart and soul into everything to do with our new Collagen Beauty™ flavours. From reading every single bit of feedback we've received from you over the years, to searching the country for the absolute best and most pure ingredients to create our natural flavours with, trialling hundreds of different combinations (we're all looking extra glowy ✨) until we nailed our three out-of-this-world Collagen Beauty™ flavours that we know you will love as much as we do, and to bringing it all to life this last week.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Collagen Beauty™ and our new flavours are a product we are truly proud of. We are blown away every single day by all the reviews we receive. Collagen Beauty™ does far more than significantly improving skin, hair, nails and gut health from within. It gives women (and men) more confidence in themselves, it helps people to feel their best from the inside out, and it gives everyone an opportunity to practice self care everyday in a way that is easy and actually works. It genuinely changes lives (read some of our reviews in our story highlights), and at the end of the day, that is exactly what we are here to do.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's such an honour to be a part of the health, wellness and beauty routines of your families. We're always thankful for your continual support of our family business.

nutra organics,"Via @thekindparentingcompany ✨ ""I am extremely grateful to @nutraorganics for creating a range of products that REALLY make a difference. I had tried several different superfood powders to off set the fact that my two were super fussy eaters and every single time it was a waste of money because they simply would not consume the powders no matter how cleverly I disguised them! I’m a big believer in whole foods and nutrition first and foremost but when you have a truly fussy eater (or two) it can be really tricky to meet their needs for health and wellness and sometimes, a supplement can be really beneficial. For our family, we found massive relief in knowing that we could get some protein, vitamins and minerals into the boys via a smoothie and the Thriving Powder. The Vanilla Thriving powder became a staple in our household long before I connected with Nutra Organics!
I am a proud ambassador of their products and LOVE the thriving powder, collagen beauty and collagen build. I am regularly hitting the bottom of the tubs, and it’s not a battle.
Collagen beauty and collagen build are flavourless and dissolve into liquids super easily while adding protein amongst other health benefits for the gut, skin and overall well being. As always, it’s important to do your own research and choose products you feel comfortable with. I trust @nutraorganics whole heartedly 💕"".

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Granola is such an easy and delicious way to start the day, particularly on the days you just need to throw breakfast together and get on with life. The problem with lots of store-bought granola is that there is always an ingredient or two that you would rather not have in there, and it’s amazing how much sugar can creep into some products. Making your own granola at home is a great option for having full control over what goes in so that you get the healthy delicious breakfast that you deserve! We’ve put together this recipe for you to try. It’s a satisfying mix of nuts and grains, with added protein to keep the macronutrients balanced. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

-
""Nutrition has been a huge part of my recovery and something I had to learn, was to not REMOVE my favourite foods from my diet but to find ALTERNATIVES that satisfied the same craving. I tried making an açai bowl in place of ice cream. Açai bowls in a cafe are so expensive on the GC, you’d need to remortgage your house , so I kept it simple with a frozen banana, two tablespoons of @nutraorganics açai berry blend and 100mls of milk/water/juice and topped with hemps seeds. Cost me a couple of dollars to make myself and two minutes of my time- it was just as delicious and an awesome alternative to ice cream. So I’m pretty pleased and will be adding it to the swap THAT for THIS highlight reel. The 200g container of berry powder I used has enough for 20 bowls and each teaspoon is the equivalent to a punnet of berries.""

nutra organics,"Will Collagen Build make you huge? 💪 For anyone worried about getting big, bulky and buff from taking Collagen Build - never fear. Collagen Build will not morph you into the hulk.
-
To really bulk up takes a big amount of effort. In short, to make some serious #gains, you need to eat far more food than you would normally consume (all food - not just protein), regularly do heavy lifting to stimulate muscle growth, and the help of hormones. Without these three things, no supplement (including Collagen Build) will make you huge.
-
Our Collagen Build is designed to improve your body composition, meaning increase and improve muscle mass whilst decreasing fat mass - but again this doesn't mean you'll end up looking like The Rock.
-
If you want to bulk up, a high energy diet (high in protein and carbs) and heavy lifting exercise will get you there. If you want to slim down, a lower energy diet with longer fasting hours and resistance training will get you there. Either way, Collagen Build will help you reach your goal by improving your muscle quality, increasing strength, toning your body, speeding up muscle recovery time and shedding fat mass, thanks to a good source of protein, magnesium and the muscle targeting Bodybalance® collagen peptides, when taken alongside resistance training and a healthy varied diet.
-
So in summary, Collagen Build on its own won’t give you a hulk-like physique. Whatever your body composition goal is, Collagen Build combined with the appropriate diet and exercise will be there to help you get the most out of your workouts - whether it’s muscle gains, shedding fat mass or a bit of both.

nutra organics,"What's the difference between Collagen Beauty, Collagen Body and Collagen Build? 🌟 If there’s one product that everyone past their twenties needs in their pantry, it’s hands down collagen. With masses of glowing ladies swearing by collagen for firmer, dewy, silky smooth skin, lush hair, long nails, stronger bones, improved muscle tone and a healthier gut, is there anything this miracle working powder can’t do?
-
As with all fads in the health food realm, it’s always best to do your research and ensure you are getting the highest quality product. Fortunately, collagen powder is a product that isn’t just touted by celebrities and health gurus, it is also backed by scientific research. However as it turns out, there’s many different types of collagen available, and not all collagen is created equal.
-
There’s different animal based sources, different types of collagen within those sources, and different collagen peptides structures within those types. All of these factors can greatly alter the effectiveness and benefits of the kind of collagen you are consuming.
-
Every molecule within our collagen range serves a unique and specialised purpose, that is further amplified through synergistic wholefood nutrients. Together, our collagen blends provide the most powerful targeted benefits, backed by science, without compromising on our natural, wholefood ethos. No fillers to bulk up the product, no artificial additives, and no cheap ingredients. Only the most pure, premium, bioavailable ingredients that actually do what they claim.

nutra organics,"Rockin' Moroccan Nourish Bowl with Spiced Chickpeas and Quinoa Couscous ✨ This scrumptious dish brings a whole heap of zesty and spicy flavours to the table, guaranteed to rock your tastebuds. We’ve chosen quinoa rather than couscous for this version to up the protein content and ensure you are getting a good dose of all your essential amino acids.
-
Chickpeas are another source of protein and ½ a cup also contains over 100% of your recommended daily intake of folate (so if you needed an excuse to eat more hummus, here it is). Tahini is also a good source of iron, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, thiamin and niacin (so many reasons to eat hummus!). We have also included our Chicken Bone Broth, which adds more B vitamins and tastes amazing.
-
The spices are anti inflammatory and contain heaps of antioxidants. The citrus gives you a dose of vitamin C, great for your immune system, and also helps to make the plant sources of iron more bioavailable.

nutra organics,"Keto Collagen Coffee ☕ Never again do you have to choose between a morning protein smoothie or your magic bean juice (aka coffee). Keto collagen coffee is here, and it’s not going anywhere!
-
Celebs and fitness gurus have been touting the myriad of benefits of keto/bulletproof coffee for years, describing it as rocket fuel to power you from 6am till noon without a single pitstop in between.
-
We always approach food trends such as these with a touch of caution because we firmly believe a well varied and balanced wholefood diet is the true foundation to maintaining good health. So when we took on the keto coffee challenge, we decided to make it more well rounded and supercharge it even further with a highly bioavailable source of protein and a variety of healthy fats to get in a bit more goodness, without compromising on the keto rocket fuel vibes.
-
Our Keto Collagen Coffee recipe contains a high quality source of bioavailable protein in the form of Bioactive Collagen Peptides found in whichever of our collagen products you decide to pick out of your pantry. This means that not only will your keto collagen coffee be supporting your energy needs but also your skin, hair & nails with Collagen Beauty; toning, repairing and building muscle with Collagen Build; or your bone strength & structure with Collagen Body.
-
Switching up the usual bulletproof butter situation for almond butter, and adding in some fatty goodness for sustained energy with coconut oil and coconut milk, this more wholesome alternative is geniunely yum and will keep you alert, energised and full for far longer than the average coffee.

nutra organics,"Q: How should I take Collagen Beauty for best results? 🌟 A: So many different ways! Collagen Beauty is unflavoured, and can be mixed into anything hot or cold. The most popular ways are in smoothies, coffee, tea, juice, soup, yoghurt, oats, or in a protein shake, and can also be mixed into food. We don't recommend drinking it straight on water as you may pick up a slight taste, but it works great mixed into anything with a flavour and won't alter the taste.
-
For the best possible results, take the full dose (12g/1 metric tablespoon) daily, at any time of the day, and for at least 8 weeks. Most customers notice results within weeks and even days, but take for 8 weeks straight for best results. And take before & after photos of your skin, hair and nails to see the transformation!

-
OzHarvest are incredible. They are Australia’s leading food rescue organisation, collecting quality excess food from commercial outlets and delivering it directly to more than 1300 charities supporting people in need across the country. They have rescued 37,000 tonnes of food that would be otherwise wasted, and delivered 109 million meals to Aussies in need since 2004 👏🏼👏🏼
-
Here's a few facts about food wastage and people in need, taken from OzHarvest's website:
1. Nearly four million Aussies experience food insecurity each year, one quarter are children.
2. Over 710,000 Aussies rely on food relief each month.
3. Over 5 million tonnes of food ends up as landfill in Australia, enough to fill 9,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.
4. One in five shopping bags end up in the bin = $3,800 worth of groceries per household each year.
5. The Government estimates food waste costs the Australian economy $20 billion each year.
-
There is more than enough food to go around to care for everyone in our country, and we are so grateful for the work that OzHarvest does, and proud that a portion of your purchases with us will be going to help to nourish our country.

-
We chose to use sweet potato for this version because the gentle sweet flavour is oh-so good with a sprinkling of salt. Also, sweet potatoes are a good source of beta-carotene and contain a bit more fibre than your standard potato (which helps to get your digestion moving in the morning). Tapioca Flour has a lower GI than standard flour and it gives the hash brown a really satisfying texture.
-
To complete this breakfast, and make sure we are all starting our day with a balanced meal, we have paired our ridiculously easy and delicious hash browns with an egg (protein, tick) avocado (healthy fat, tick) kale and spinach (fibre, vitamin A, vitamin C, B6, calcium, magnesium, iron, tick tick tick). We also included some gut-loving sauerkraut and our Wholefood Pantry Hemp Seeds and Pepitas to make sure we have covered a massive spectrum of nutrients.

nutra organics,"PROJECT GIVE BACK - PART 2 🌲 We are proudly partnering with Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund (CNCF) to plant 2,000 trees in Australia over the next 6 months, as part of our Project Give Back commitment to help clean up our coastline, plant more trees, and provide meals to those in need.
-
CNCF has planted over 5.4 million trees since 2007 on degraded land in Australia, to support natural ecosystems and wildlife, and help reverse some of the damage that mass deforestation has caused in our country. CNCF’s approach is to take degraded, unused farmland and restore the natural habitat by planting a mix of native vegetation that are indigenous to the area. Planting trees offsets the carbon emissions we create everyday, and they are absolutely crucial to the health of our planet and wildlife.
-
Here’s a few facts as to why we are taking action to help plant more trees:
1. Australia is one of the top 10 deforesters in the world, and has lost nearly 40% of its bushland and forest.
2. Trees are critical for maintaining safe levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide on our planet. They filter air and water from harmful pollutants, and they help cool the planet by vacuuming up harmful greenhouse grasses and turning it into oxygen. In cities, trees can reduce overall temperatures by up to 8 degrees Celsius.
3. Native trees also assist our agricultural areas to be more sustainable, prevent salinity and soil erosion, provide shade, shelter, food and habitat to native animals.
4. The effect of land clearing has been disastrous. Around 20% of Australian mammals, 7% of reptiles, 13% of birds are listed as Extinct, Endangered or Vulnerable, including koalas.
5. Only 10% Australian land being cleared is being restored, so we’re racking up an extreme environmental debt that we aren’t keeping up with.
-
The rate of deforestation in our home is so alarming, and we all need to do our bit to help if we want Australia to stay beautiful and healthy. We are also transitioning our range into either more sustainable or 100% home compostable packaging. We will announce our next transition phase next month.

nutra organics,"PROJECT GIVE BACK - PART 1 🌊 We are so excited to announce our partnership with Clean Ocean Foundation to clean up 100km of Australian beaches over the next 6 months! Earlier this week we announced our 6 month Project Give Back commitment to our environment and community, to clean up 100km our coastline, plant 2,000 trees, and provide 30,000 meals to those in need.
-
Clean Ocean Foundation is an Australian charity whose aim is to reduce all forms of ocean pollution. We have partnered with them to fund the clean up of 10 different sites in Australia over the next 6 months that have a high density of litter, that are 10km long, with teams spending 10 hours cleaning up each site.
-
Here's a few facts about why we are taking action to help clean up our beaches:
1. Globally, 8 million items of litter enter the marine environment everyday, with estimates of 70% ending up on the sea bed, 15% on beaches and 15% floating on the surface.
2. According to research by CSIRO, 75% of rubbish along the Australian coast is plastic, and the density of plastic ranges from a few thousand pieces to over 40,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre.
3. In one day, Australians produce enough plastic waste to fill an entire beach.
4. Plastic takes up to 1000 years to decompose and every piece can therefore kill more than one marine animal.
5. At least 77 species of marine wildlife found in Australian waters are affected by entanglement in or ingestion of marine debris. It's believed over half of all sea turtles are harmed by plastic ingestion.
-
This is the second step we are taking to help reduce waste in our country and beaches, with our first step being our commitment to moving our entire range away from plastic and into compostable or more sustainable packaging. This is a long process, but we are making progress, and will announce the next transition phase next month. We've already launched our first product in 100% home compostable packaging (our Collagen Beauty Bars), and we've removed all plastic scoops from our products.

It uses our Hearty Mushroom Beef Bone Broth as a base, which effortlessly adds heaps of flavour and nutrients into the meal. With the cooler temperatures and shorter days of winter, you might not be seeing enough sun, so this is particularly good as it uses a mushroom powder that provides a dietary source of Vitamin D. With chilli and garlic, this broth will warm you up and comfort you if you're run down, or make you feel cozy on a cold winter's night.

Adaptogen is a term used to describe a group of specific traditional herbs that have been utilised in natural healing modalities such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Herbalism for centuries.

-
Judging by the way the characters talk about the bowls of brown, the only thing that this recipe will really have in common with the King's Landing peasant dish is that it will be brown, and served in a bowl. We still want it to be nutritious and tasty, so we are going with a hearty beef stew. Plus even though winter has been and gone in Westeros (thanks Arya), winter is coming for us in the real world, and we need all the immune boosting broth we can get!

What you may not know is that I came across Collagen Beauty just over a year ago and everyone was raving about it at the time. I used it for about 8 weeks to see the results for myself BEFORE recommending it my family, friends, clients, and my insta fam. Now I’m obsessed 😁
Since I announced my pregnancy, I’ve had SO many of you ask me if the Collagen Beauty is pregnancy safe and if I’m still using it. YES and YES. Usually I put it in my morning smoothie everyday because I’m a creature of habit and this will ensure that I have it. But because it is unflavoured and temperature resistant, you can also add it to any meals that you cook. I know a lot of my clients add it to their morning coffee!""

Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse. A lot of people get excited about the whites because they are such a great protein source, but it’s the yolks that really give eggs their superfood status. They contain healthy fats and fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D (so it’s like eating sunshine - perfect for when you aren’t getting enough actual sunshine). Speaking of vitamin D, we have used our Hearty Mushroom Chicken Bone Broth in this recipe, which is another source of our sunshine vitamin, as well as B vitamins and Zinc - all important for supporting your immune system!

As a parent, it can be really frustrating and challenging to combat fussiness. Sometimes you just have to do the best you can, try all the tricks in the books and often wait it out. One thing we did when the boys were toddlers was to introduce a daily non negotiable smoothie. Matt used to call it “The good behaviour smoothie” because we noticed a visible difference in their temperament- full satisfied bellies make for happier kids!
-
I’m often asked about this recipe so thought I would post it here in case you would like to try it with your little ones! (Always double check any ingredients you’re unsure of/ leave the nut butter out if you like)
-
We searched high and low for products we felt happy with. It was during a hospital stay for glandular fever that a fellow mum shared Thriving Protein with me and I instantly googled it!
-
This is our smoothie from when the boys were over two years old. ＋ 1 scoop of Vanilla @nutraorganics thriving protein ＋ 1 serve of @nutraorganics Collagen Beauty Powder ＋ Macadamia Milk ＋ 1 ripe banana or 1/2 cup frozen banana ＋ 1 tablespoon of nut butter ＋ A handful of spinach leaves
-
Blitz everything in the blender and serve 🥛 We introduced the Vanilla Thriving Protein gradually, and it’s the only protein powder the boys have ever happily had. Unlike a whey protein, it is unlikely to upset tummies. I love the ingredients and love knowing the boys are getting a good whack of vitamins and minerals like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and more.
-
Collagen Beauty Powder is the product we burn through the most. Our whole family consumes this. It is flavourless and odourless and dissolves into liquids. It’s great for gut health and is 100% protein. My number one girl crush Gwyneth Paltrow is all about adding collagen to her diet too 💁🏼""

It's really easy to prepare but looks and tastes super sophisticated because it combines some seriously delicious flavours and textures. It's light and fresh but also comforting and wholesome, the perfect in-between season meal when you just don't know what you feel like eating (or how to dress).
-
We have used The Wholefood Pantry Quinoa as our base for this salad. We don't get tired of this superfood as it contains a complete protein profile and is packed with micronutrients. The asparagus provides a source of folate, vitamin C, vitamin E and iron, plus most of your B vitamins. It's a great source of fibre, and antioxidants (including some awesome polyphenol called quercetin). Peaches provide a source of vitamin C, Niacin and antioxidants, but most importantly, they taste amazing and chargrilling them brings out delicious caramel tones (and makes you look really fancy!) 💁 Pepitas have been included to provide some crunch, but also for their added protein, vitamins and minerals. And obviously, goat's cheese is added because it's goat's cheese - enough said! (But if you must know, it also provides complete protein, calcium and vitamin A).

nutra organics,"Permission to add dark chocolate to your beauty food arsenal, granted! 🍫 It gets the glowing tick of approval from our Nutritionist, and here's why ✨
-
Cacao, and dark chocolate (as in over 70% cocoa – not the milky sugary stuff) is really nutritious and is great for your general health as well as great for glowing skin.  Dark chocolate is a good source of iron, magnesium, copper and manganese, and also contains some zinc, phosphorus and selenium, but its main super power is the huge amount of antioxidants it contains.
-
It’s full of polyphenols, flavanols and catechins (all different types of antioxidants) and studies have found that cocoa and dark chocolate are even more effective at neutralising free radicals than many super fruits and berries (including blueberries and acai)! Cacao’s amazing antioxidant profile helps to protect your skin from the sun and prevent UV damage, as well as improving circulation, which encourages new skin growth, repair, hydration and gives your skin a healthy glow.

nutra organics,"Bone broth sits in our top 17 foods for beautiful skin, and the reason why might surprise you! ✨ Bone Broth provides a dietary source of Hyaluronic Acid, which is something our body produces itself (in relatively small quantities), and something you are probably used to putting on your face rather than in your mouth. It’s great to be able to supplement the diet with a bit more Hyaluronic Acid, because it has this amazing ability to bind 1000x its own weight in water. It sits within deeper layers of the skin keeping the skin hydrated and looking plump (which is why it is often used as an injectable too). Bone broth also contains some collagen… and if you've read any of the reviews on our Collagen Beauty, you'd know how good that is for your skin too!
-
Our dehydrated Bone Broth powders are a great place to start if you are new to broths!

⋆ Mix into yogurt, oats and chia puddings.
⋆ Dissolve into soups and sauces, or add it to a cup of our broth. Collagen is temperature resistant, so heat won't affect the nutrients.
⋆ Add into your baking. Think bliss balls, muffins, slices and savoury cooking too.

Unfortunately, we can’t all jet off to Japan every day to soak in an Onsen, but we can try to replicate some of the benefits in the bath at home.
-
It’s important to keep what you’re adding to your bath as natural as possible. Chemically, heavily perfumed and soapy products can upset the balance of bacteria on your skin (because just like your gut, your skin also has a balanced ecosystem of microorganisms, and harsh treatment can disrupt that balance, leaving it wide open for harmful bacteria and fungi!). Adding salts, like Dead Sea Salt and our Wholefood Pantry Himalayan Crystal Salt, provides minerals which boost circulation, provide relief for sore muscles and joints and can assist with skin healing.
-
Soaking in a bath can be incredibly calming for a busy and stressed out mind as well. Add in some dried flowers to bring your bath to a whole new level of luxury. The gentle scent of rose and jasmine (or any of your favourites) will do wonders for your well being.

nutra organics,"Collagen Body is back in stock! 🌟 For anyone wondering what the difference is between Collagen Beauty and Collagen Body, it's that they contain different collagen peptides, which are smaller collagen molecules with specific targeted benefits. The peptides called Fortibone in Collagen Body target bones & joints, whereas the peptides called Verisol in Collagen Beauty target skin, hair and nails. Here's what some of the recent reviewers have said about Collagen Body:
-
""I have been adding 1 scoop in my daily cup of bone broth as an extra boost of collagen to help my body recover from an injury I did to my knee. I am pretty happy with my body and how it has been responding, plus loving the added benefit that my nails are getting stronger and longer."" - Sandra

""I started taking it to help ease pain in my knees. Ive noticed after a month that my recovery time post-workout is shorter and my knees dont hurt nearly as much during a workout."" - Shaya

""Fantastic collagen powder, I used it to help after I hurt my back and shoulder at work and suffered muscle lose. It has helped my gut problems as well which was a added bonus."" - Brooke

nutra organics,"WHY YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR BODY DURING A DETOX ✧ We are all very aware that exercise is good for your health and weight management. But how does it specifically help with a cleanse? 🌿
-
One of the most important parts about moving your body is something called interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid is the fluid that our body cells are surrounded by. It provides nutrients to the cells and removes waste products. The kicker is: interstitial fluid doesn’t move on its own. Because it’s not contained within blood vessels, it isn’t being moved around by “blood pressure”. To get lymph fluid moving, and get those toxins out of our tissues, we have to contract our muscles so that the interstitial fluid returns to the bloodstream (via the lymph system) so that it can be filtered, and the toxins removed. If we don’t move, our tissues literally just sit there bathing in their own toxins. Also, we can eliminate toxins through our sweat. Win win!
-
So as part of your cleanse regime outlined in our free Wholefood Summer Cleanse ebook, we’re not suggesting that you to train for a marathon, but we definitely want you to be doing a decent bit of moving every day!

Many champagnes and cocktails to cheer in the New Year, extreme carb loading in the name of not letting Christmas leftovers go to waste, and finishing all those boxes of chocolate gifted from relatives is enough to send anyone deep into a food coma after the holiday season. You’re most likely interested in this cleanse because, let’s be honest, you’re feeling a little more mashed potato than skinny fry, a little more Shrek than Cinderella, and a little more sad saggy underwear than sassy panties, and the hope of cleansing away the holiday season’s dietary sins is probably on your mind.
-
Every so often, we get ourselves into a cycle of over indulgence and start feeling a bit slothful. And never is this feeling more common and universally felt than right after the Christmas and New Year holidays. It’s no wonder that more people join a gym and start a diet in January than any other month!
-
We have designed this Wholefood Cleanse Guide to give you real, healthy and achievable Nutritionist and Naturopath approved advice and recipes to kick start your cleanse, get you feeling back on top of your game, and set you up for a clean and healthy year.

This cleanse guide is designed to support your body while it catches up with the backlog of over indulgence, by providing clean energy, fibre and a wide variety of nutrients that are essential to good health. These tips, which are designed to support your body during a cleanse, are useful bits of advice to also incorporate into everyday life. So although a “cleanse” might be short term, we hope it will help you build some great long-term habits too.

For so long we pushed the very idea aside as something only gym junkies looking to get shredded did. It brought to mind images of flavourless proteins mixed with equally flavourless steamed vegetables served with a hearty serving of boredom, rinsed and repeated seven-days a week until you have lost all will to live.
-
Ok, maybe it isn’t that extreme for you, but regardless, we’re here to tell you that meal prep does not have to be boring, it does not mean lack of flavour and it definitely isn’t only meant for athletes competing at the top tier of their chosen sports.
-
Meal prep, to put it simply, is here to set you up for success. It means being thoughtful about what you are consuming, and providing healthy and convenient options that will fuel your body with nourishing vitamins and minerals rather than processed options that are so easy to grab without a second thought, and will mean, that come summer you’re going to step out on the town feeling so confident because you have fuelled your body with nutrients rather than nutritionally void junk.

nutra organics,"Ever since we’ve traded bikinis for beanies, the thought of waking up at 5 am to hit the gym in Winter is chilling enough to give anyone a brain freeze. Who would rationally choose waking up at a dark, ungodly hour to do the usual ‘Summer body come at me’ circuit, rather than sleep in a little longer to procrastinate the unwelcome chill shock that hits as soon as you reluctantly peel off the blankets?
-
And who in their right mind would eat an iceberg salad (and everything else in the ‘Summer shred’ diet) in the icy cold for the sake of the elusive bikini bod, when slow-cooked comfort food is calling from the kitchen? Hint: not us!
-
But Winter’s frosty bite doesn’t freeze us in our tracks from chasing our fitness goals and nourishing ourselves with the best that seasonal food offers to support our health and wellbeing. It may be a little outrageous to wake up at the crack of dawn for the gym, and our usual salads may be off the menu for the next few months, but there is still no reason to hibernate from our health and fitness goals when it’s what we love doing regardless of the temperature outside.

nutra organics,"We're doing something a little bit juicy 🍑✨ Well, a lot juicy... 9 whole litres of organic, cold-pressed juice kinda juicy. You guessed it, we're on a 3 day juice and broth cleanse! We're honeymooning with ourselves this month and dedicating it to some much needed self-love, and our first stop is an internal spring clean with an organic 3 day juice cleanse pack from @solcleanse along with our Bone Broths.
-
So, what is the deal with juice and broth cleanses, and why should you consider doing one too? Your gut works really hard everyday to digest food, absorb nutrients, produce seratonin (the happy hormone), and is home to 100 trillion bacteria - both good and bad. By not eating any solid food for 3 days and just drinking organic juice and bone broth, you are giving your digestive system a break, supporting your liver to detox, and allowing your body to start to repair itself. This break from digestion gives your good bacteria a holiday so that they can work their magic on your gut lining, and focus on removing toxins from your system.
-
A juice & broth cleanse also helps you to feel clear and energised, happier, and will increase your immunity. It can also help you to identify food intolerances, and with the break from cooking food, it gives you extra time to practice mindfulness and self-love.
-
If this sounds like the kind of royal treatment you'd love to give your body, find a local organic cold-press juicer (if you live in Byron, Gold Coast or Brisbane, @solcleanse is our fave), along with your favourite Nutra Organics Bone Broth (available in beef, chicken and veggie). We'll be sharing more on this soon, and in the meantime, learn about the benefits of our Bone Broth and shop via link in profile ✨ #nutraorganics #selflove #selfcare",02-05-2018,1,02-05-2018,,0,499,13,https://www.instagram.com/p/BiRSPJYBKvz/,

We’re honeymooning right where we are. Amidst the whirlwind of crazy antics, endless to-do list, the madness & the mundane, we’re taking what time we have to listen to our bodies and give ourselves some much needed, healthy, tender loving care.

Self-love isn’t narcissistic, it’s not about being selfish, and doesn’t require an overseas holiday or expensive pampering. It’s less about running away from normality, and more about making the normal beautiful. It’s about slowing down. Breathing in. Learning. Growing. Adjusting. And using what moments you have to yourself in the day to make the normal wonderful again.

nutra organics,"Collagen Beauty vs Beauty Berries Hemp Protein, which one is right for you? ♡ Your skin is made up of over 75% collagen, a naturally occuring protein in your body that gives your skin elasticity and firmness. Your body starts to produce less collagen in your late 20s when the signs of ageing begin to appear (wrinkles, brittle hair and weak nails). Both of these products help your body to produce more collagen itself in order to improve your skin, hair and nails. So what is the difference?
-
Collagen Beauty contains actual collagen, the protein found in skin and connective tissue (and is therefore not vegan - we use a bovine source as it is the closest collagen structure to our own), plus the clinically proven collagen peptides called Verisol which actively target collagen production in your skin, hair and nails. Collagen is also essential for gut health, and contains the amino acids necessary for restoring and repairing your gut lining. It is a flavourless and odourless white powder, which can be mixed into anything hot or cold, and when taken daily it visibly reduces fine lines, cellulite, hydrates skin, and strengthens hair & nails.
-
Beauty Berries Hemp Protein is a wholesome vegan protein blend, fortified with antioxidant rich berries, Vitamin C and Zinc which help your body produce more collagen, together with the herb horsetail that is naturally high in silica to support healthy hair and nails. Combined with hemp (the most bioavailable plant-based source of protein and rich in omegas 3, 6 & 9), sprouted and biofermented pea protein, pre and probiotics and fibre, this nourishing protein blend provides a variety of nutrients to support a plant-based diet, with the extra benefit of vegan ingredients that help your body produce more collagen.
-
So, in short, if you are vegan or in need of a wholesome protein supplement - take Beauty Berries Hemp Protein. If you are not vegan and want the best possible results for improving your skin, hair, nails & gut health - take Collagen Beauty.

Our new Hemp Proteins are Certified Organic vegan blends of hemp protein, sprouted & bio-fermented pea protein and sacha inchi protein. This means that our Hemp Protein range has a broad spectrum of amino acids from a variety of plant based protein sources to ensure it is not only the most digestible protein on the market but also the most complete a plant protein can be. With the added benefits of wholesome superfoods, our Hemp Proteins are a gut-friendly complete protein with zinc, vitamin C, pre & probiotics, fibre and healthy fats to nourish your insides and keep you feeling satisfied for longer.
-
With three delicious flavours, all containing their own unique health benefits, there is a hemp protein for everyone. Our Salted Cacao Maca Hemp Protein is great for supporting your Inner Balance & Wellbeing, with the addition of Organic Peruvian Maca and Ashwaganda. Beauty Berries Hemp Protein is for a Vegan Collagen Promoting Glow, and contains antioxidant rich berries along with the herb horsetail to support your skin, hair and nail health. Our Creamy Vanilla Hemp Protein delivers a delicious Alkaline Greens Boost, and is by far the best tasting way to increase your intake of phytonutrients from greens including barley grass, spirulina, alfalfa, chlorella, kelp and green tea matcha.

If you want delicious, healthy, glowing skin - it’s time to start feeding it accordingly with skin food. And we don’t just mean the kind of skin food that you eat (hint: our Collagen Beauty). We mean, quite literally, lathering nature’s goods all over your noggin ✨
-
It’s not as glamorous as what this ethereal hand bath may suggest. You might find it more on the sticky side and less on the soothing side. You’ll probably smell more like your breakfast and less like these flowers.

But despite the lack of glamour and probable mess, you’ll come out the other side with skin that glows like the sun and feels like a baby’s bum!

Honestly, would treadmills even exist if it weren't for the beats that make running in one spot and staring at a wall fun?

Keeping fit and working out is something everyone at Nutra HQ actively does because it is so important for a healthy balanced lifestyle, which is what we're all about 💪 And how do we muster up the motivation for sweating it out regularly? A damn good workout playlist!

If you're like us and don't vibe with the weird monotonous techno tunes that seem to dominate the Spotify workout playlists, then we've shared with you our 4 favourite Spotify playlists to help motivate you during your gym sesh!

There's alternative motivational beats for the Triple J lovers, old school sweat tunes for the RnB Friday fans, upbeat workout bangers for the pop music junkies, and chilled yoga/pilates jams for when you need a little more inner zen in your life.

Hemp seeds are among the most nutritious foods in the world. They are rich in healthy fats, have a perfect balance of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids, and they're also a good source of vitamin E and minerals. Hemp seeds are high in protein, containing all nine essential amino acids. They are about 30% protein making them one of the best plant based protein sources available, and are easily digestible. Just 1 serve (2 tbsp) of hemp seeds provides 8.76g of protein.

nutra organics,"✨ ‘I love you’. ✨ Three little words that shape their little world. Self esteems are built on ‘I love you’. Worry is annulled by ‘I love you’. Connection is embedded in ‘I love you’. And confidence for the day soars upon the ‘I love you’s’ whispered at bedtime. When we say I love you to our children, we are saying, you matter to me, and it underpins all that they are.
-
Did you know that ‘I love you’ has a language? And that spoken words are just one of five possible ways to say I love you that we resonate with? Dr Gary Chapman calls these ‘Love Languages’, and suggests we each have a primary ‘love language’ that to us says I love you, in a more meaningful way. We’re more likely to have a few love languages we connect with, but one or two may stand out more than others.
-
One of our mums here at Nutra, Ema, beautifully illustrates these languages and how she has discovered to love her two boys in the most meaningful way with each of their unique love languages. Read her heartfelt words and honest insight that will inspire you to love more, love meaningfully and to love some more again via #linkinprofile ❤🌟 #nutraorganics #family #lovelanguage

Banana Bread first appeared during the Great Depression, which began with in the 1930s making every scrap of food precious. Households were unwilling to throw away anything — even a “rotten” banana.

nutra organics,"Soaking grains/quinao? What are the benefits?
Whole grains contain an anti-nutrient called phytic acid which binds with certain minerals (e.g. zinc, phosphorous, calcium and iron) and prevents them from being absorbed by the body. Phytic acid is also very hard on the digestive system.
Phytic acid is also an enzyme-inhibitor which keeps the grains/seeds dormant until the conditions for germination are just right.
Phytic acid can be neutralized in as little as 7 hours when soaked in water with the addition of a small amount of an acidic medium such as vinegar or lemon juice, so pour your quinoa into a bowl and cover with warm or room temp water. Add a tablespoon of something acidic eg. apple cider vinegar, lemon juice or kefir. Allow to sit at room temp for at least 7 hours. The benefits for digestion and mineral bioavailability is mind blowing, what a difference this one easy method can make.

You may be sceptical about our flavour combo, other's have been to but once you have a taste you will be hooked.
We are in love with Turmeric, and there some very good reasons why we included a lot of it in our new Clean Protein flavour.
Turmeric has powerful antioxidant effects. Not only does it neutralise free radicals, it stimulates the body’s own antioxidant enzymes. Here's a fun fact that will blow your mind.....The active ingredient in turmeric called curcumin, is a natural anti-inflammatory compound, and it is 2000 times more available to your body when taken with black pepper! Of course we included black pepper into our blend, who wants to eat nutrition that you can't absorb.

Because we wanted to make having Beef Bone Broth extra convenient, we had to skim the fat off the broth before the drying process, which is a bummer because the fat found in bone broth is extremely nourishing. But never fear, by adding a small teaspoon of coconut oil (which is filled with medium-chain fatty acids and healthy saturated fat) to your broth, you can reap the full Bone Brothy benefits!

There is a lot of controversy about alcohol content in fermented drinks. Yes, there is a small amount of alcohol in kombucha and kefir, but if you ferment at home you can make sure your alcohol content is kept low. Most fermented drinks, if brewed properly, will have a lower alcohol content than orange juice.
I add freeze dried organic fruit blends. This way, you reduce the fermenting time and keep the alcohol content to the lowest possible.

Protein Packed, sugar free smoothie! 💪 || Recipe:
👉Dessertspoon Brazil nuts & cashews 👉Dessertspoon chia seeds 👉Scoop of @nutraorganics clean protein 👉water and ice  I've stopped starting my day with fruit in my smoothies because it makes me crave sugar through the day (sugar addict 🙋). I'm feeling so much better now! I still love my smoothies though and have found starting my day with lots of healthy fats and proteins keeps me satiated and minimises bad cravings- carbs do not have a hormone 'full' switch like proteins and fats 🙈. I Personally love @nutraorganics range because I know their level of integrity in creating a clean product. I'm super impressed with this new range of protein powders and they taste great! They have loads of sprouted and fermented ingredients and extra digestive enzymes and a whole bunch of other health promoting goodies such as turmeric, kelp, milk thistle and ginger 🙌 I love knowing I'm starting my day with a good boost in my nutrition #soyum #cleanprotein #sugarfree #glutenfree #wholefood #nourish #cleaneating #paleo",05-08-2015,0,,,0,86,1,https://www.instagram.com/p/5_w52QOLs0/,

Vegan blueberry banana and coconut muffins, these are so healthy they are practically breakfast worthy (but you would never guess!) to make: blend up 2 cups rolled oats into a coarse flour (a few chunky bits here and there are fine). Tip this flour into a bowl and add 2 tbsp spelt flour (or other) 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp bicarbonate soda, 2 tbsp chia seed, 1/4 cup @nutraorganics coconut and 2-3 tbsp @natvianaturalsweetener baking stevia. Mix this all up then stir in 3 tbsp oil (olive, rice bran or coconut), 1.5 large (or two smaller) ripe bananas, mashed, 2/3 cup soy or nut milk. When combined, gently stir in 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. Spoon the mix into a muffin tray lined with patty pans (should make 8-9) and top with a few extra berries. Bake at 180C for 15-25 mins depending on your oven. Enjoy! Best eaten warm 😉",25-07-2015,0,,,0,52,3,https://www.instagram.com/p/5jmLIxOLhS/,

These classic protein balls are ready to roll in less than 20 seconds using the #thermomix & are great to keep in the freezer for when the afternoon chocolate cravings hit 😍😍😍 I've experimented lately using organic dried figs and sultanas instead of dates but these ones are still the favourite ❤️❤️❤️
RECIPE - Process 120 g raw activated almonds for 5 seconds on speed 9. Add 150 g medjool organic dates, 30 g raw cacao powder, 40 to 50 g shredded organic coconut, 1 tbs chia seeds, 1 to 2 tsp linseeds, 1 scoop natural protein powder ( I use a bio fermented brand - thriving protein ) & 1 to 2 tbs either tahini, nut butter or coconut oil. Process on speed 9 for around 15 secs until the mixture is sticky. You can add a tiny amount of water if needed. Roll into balls and coat in cacao nibs, sesame seeds, coconut, chia seeds or crushed nuts and freeze 😍😍😍

nutra organics,"Nutra Organics Announcement Time
We have been working silently in the background on a special but difficult project. This special project has been us working on a new, ethical ,local chocolate range. We are extremely disappointed to say our previous chocolate supplier unbeknown to us, did not disclose that their products now come with a warning advising that they process on equipment which processes products which maycontain dairy.
Needless to say, that was not good enough for us.  You know our ethics and how important bringing our own families, you and your families the best quality ingredients is. We have initiated a product recall in the meantime, which reflects the affected batches which were produced in November of 2013.
Our team are so excited to confirm that since December we have been overseeing the production of and using an all new, locally made and produced chocolate that meets our high standards. Today, we can announce this arrangement is permanent and the chocolate is made exclusively for Nutra Organics, and will ensure that our products never again will be compromised by circumstances out of our control.
Every bar is handmade with love so you may notice some small differences in what you are used to, but rest assured the taste remains awesome. If there are some inconsistencies in one bar to the next this is why. Our bar range is just like us - completely individual - just the way we like it.
We hope you appreciate the work and quality, as we work super hard to provide the BEST! #nutraorganics #chocolate #announcement #ethical #bars #superfoodsbars",26-03-2014,0,,,0,54,6,https://www.instagram.com/p/l_YVAjuLlP/,
