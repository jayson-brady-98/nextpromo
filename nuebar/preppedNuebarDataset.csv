nuebar,"One of our favourite ingredients in the Oily Face bar is Neem oil.
🌱
Derived from the seeds of the neem tree, this wonder ingredient has been used in traditional medicine for various skin conditions, including acne, due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Neem oil contains compounds such as azadirachtin, nimbin, and nimbidin, which have strong antibacterial properties which help to balance acne-causing bacteria on the skin.
🌱
The anti-inflammatory properties contained in Neem oil can also help reduce redness, swelling, and irritation associated with acne. Inflammation is a key factor in the development and exacerbation of acne lesions. Finally, Neem oil can also be helpful with regulating sebum (oil) production, which is a common factor in the development of acne as it prevents pores from becoming clogged, reducing the likelihood of acne formation.

nuebar,"What are Parabens and why should you avoid them?
🌱
Parabens are a preservative of sorts, synthetic chemicals designed to make the shelf life of hair and skin care products longer, especially those containing water (hello bottled shampoo and conditioner).
🌱
Scientific studies have raised concerns that parabens are not only responsible for some skin irritations (especially on sensitive skin), but that prolonged exposure through skin absorption, can disrupt hormones, particularly in adolescent girls and women, effecting fertility and reproductive organs, birth outcomes and even increase the risk of cancer.
🌱
In fact, new scientific data has confirmed that parabens can spur the growth of certain types of breast cancer cells.
🌱
With NueBar being a Naturopath formulated concentrated bar (rather than liquid), we have been able to do away with Parabens. In fact, your wellbeing is our priority in the formulation of our products, which is why we choose to hand pour our products, rather than machine make for mass production.

🌱
The skin is the largest organ in your body. The application of chemicals to the hair (and therefore the skin), especially when they aren’t washed out (such as styling products), can result in skin irritation and therefore flaky scalp.
🌱
This can also be the case if you are not washing the shampoo or conditioner properly from your hair on hair-wash day. When choosing hair products, opt for those that are: 
• chemical free,
• free of soaps, sulphates, silicones, parabens
• free of drying ethanol-based alcohols
🌱
Being a naturopath formulated brand, NueBar is free of all of these additives, instead we choose the best that nature can provide in plant-based, chemical free organic rich ingredients.

nuebar,"Sore Scalp?
🌱
Are you washing and brushing enough? Whilst the reasons for a sore and flaky scalp can vary a lot (do not shy away from a medical diagnosis here), the first place to look is at the frequency of cleansing.
🌱
Hair that isn’t washed or brushed enough can build up with oil, dirt and other impurities. Excess dirt, dry skin and oil can then result in scaly patches to form on the scalp and lead to further issues such as fungal growth, which can become very painful.
🌱
If you spend a lot of time exercising or working in the outdoors, we recommend washing a little more frequently, every 2-3 days at a minimum. 
🌱
Remember brushing your hair isn’t just about detangling, but about removing the dirt and impurities from your hair also, rather than relying on washing alone.

nuebar,"Oily Hair?
🌱
Reduce your wash days (and stop using soap)! Whilst this may seem odd, too much washing can upset the balance of your scalp, simply resulting in an over production of oil, to compensate that which has been stripped from your scalp.
🌱
Here's another idea: Ditch the soap! Commercial, soapy, bubble rich shampoos can be full of chemicals, which strip the natural oils from your hair, once again resulting in an over production of oil whilst the scalp attempts to balance itself.
🌱
How frequently should you wash? Well, ideally every 2-3 days using a very mild shampoo. NueBar is soap free, non-stripping and non-drying. In fact, because it is Naturopath formulated, the ingredients are purely chosen to support your hair type. Our personal favourite is the inclusion of ghassoul Clay which goes to work, to draw out dirt and impurities while the balance of oils in your scalp and hair is restored :)",08-10-2024,0,,,0,4,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/DA2yiwyz3dK/,

nuebar,"Are plant derivatives enough for your skincare routine?
🌱
The best way to look at this question is to consider the alternatives. If we were to look at chemical alternatives, this becomes a very simple answer. Being Natural, plant based ingredients are less likely to cause adverse reactions than their chemical counterparts, this makes them a wiser choice for sensitive skin in particular.
🌱
Being a gentler alternative, plant based ingredients are also less likely to strip the skin of its natural oils.
🌱
Finally, as they are jam packed with naturally occurring antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, natural antiseptic, vitamins and minerals, just like our naturally produced foods, plant based ingredients are all you really need to heal your skin!
🌱
So, if this is true, why do they make skincare products from chemical based alternatives? Well truthfully, profit. Generally man made chemicals have been produced as they are less expensive to produce, or the production has been one which provides profit to the organisation making it.
🌱
When you consider the adverse effects of chemicals on your skin, the balance of investment far outweighs the cost.

nuebar,"Let's talk about soap.
🌱
Whilst most of us were raised with store bought bars of soap to wash our bodies, little do we know about how this effects our skin.
🌱
The challenge is, the ingredients in soap frequently contain irritating chemicals chosen to either preserve the soap, clean so called 'germs' or create extra bubbles or 'lather'.
🌱
Whilst the addition of these ingredients may serve a purpose, they can also irritate sensitive (or not so sensitive skin), particularly if used frequently.
🌱
If you find that your skin is extra dry, irritated, breaking out in rashes, hives or even experiencing unusual itchiness, you may like to consider a soap free body wash. Some chemical ingredients interrupt the skin's microbiome, (natural protective microorganisms).
🌱
Instead, look for concentrated bars that contain plant based and natural ingredients, free from irritating chemicals such as SLS, Phthalates, Parabens and/or Synthetic fragrances.
🌱
Body washes containing ingredients such as sunflower oil, coconut oil and argan oil are included to support the skin's hydration, restoring, rather than stripping away the skin's natural, protective layers.
🌱
When considering fragrances, look for natural essential oils, as opposed to synthetic fragrances or opt for fragrance free if you are particularly sensitive.
🌱
Also, natural clays are wonderful ingredients to cleanse skin, rather than soap based cleansers, which can dry out the skin and strip away the skins oils.

Have you ever considered exactly what is on the bottom of your shoes at the end of the day? animal waste, pesticides, herbicides, pollen, not to mention the dirt... Keep the nasties of the streets, out of your home with a good doormat or a shoeless house policy.
🌱
Many green buildings now include entryway track-off systems as a means of maintaining a healthy interior environment. Less dirt also means less sweeping, mopping, and vacuuming, which means less work, water, energy, and fewer chemicals.

That’s over 9 million bottles per day. When you consider that, aside from creating landfill, each of these bottles has the potential to end up in our landfills or oceans, harming wildlife and polluting our beautiful landscapes.
🌱
Have you ever considered which bottles you may be able to eradicate from your life!?
🌱
Here's an idea: Do a daily tally for just a week.... and then when viewing what the bottles are used for, evaluate how you might be able to reduce your consumption.
🌱
Of course the first place to start is drink bottles, be it water or something else. The less obvious plastic bottles (or containers) might be your skin cleanser or deodorant. Given it can take 450 years for a plastic bottle to break down, add to that the fact that not every bottle can, is or will be recycled: Every little bit really does make a huge difference to keeping our planet clean.

nuebar,"One of our favourite ingredients in the Oily Face bar is Neem oil.
🌱
Derived from the seeds of the neem tree, this wonder ingredient has been used in traditional medicine for various skin conditions, including acne, due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Neem oil contains compounds such as azadirachtin, nimbin, and nimbidin, which have strong antibacterial properties which help to balance acne-causing bacteria on the skin.
🌱
The anti-inflammatory properties contained in Neem oil can also help reduce redness, swelling, and irritation associated with acne. Inflammation is a key factor in the development and exacerbation of acne lesions. Finally, Neem oil can also be helpful with regulating sebum (oil) production, which is a common factor in the development of acne as it prevents pores from becoming clogged, reducing the likelihood of acne formation.

Synthetic fragrances can strip the natural oils from your hair and scalp, leading to irritations such as dandruff and dull, lifeless, frizzy and easily tangled hair. If you already experience issues with dry and flaky scalp, be sure to check the ingredients of your current hair products, ensuring they don't contain synthetic fragrances.

nuebar,"Are plant derivatives enough for your skincare routine?
🌱
The best way to look at this question is to consider the alternatives. If we were to look at chemical alternatives, this becomes a very simple answer. Being Natural, plant based ingredients are less likely to cause adverse reactions than their chemical counterparts, this makes them a wiser choice for sensitive skin in particular.
🌱
Being a gentler alternative, plant based ingredients are also less likely to strip the skin of its natural oils.
🌱
Finally, as they are jam packed with naturally occurring antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, natural antiseptic, vitamins and minerals, just like our naturally produced foods, plant based ingredients are all you really need to heal your skin!
🌱
So, if this is true, why do they make skincare products from chemical based alternatives? Well truthfully, profit. Generally man made chemicals have been produced as they are less expensive to produce, or the production has been one which provides profit to the organisation making it.
🌱
When you consider the adverse effects of chemicals on your skin, the balance of investment far outweighs the cost.

Choosing products that are Silicone Free is important when managing Oily hair.

Look out for products detailing ingredients such as ‘dimethicone’, ‘cyclomethicone’ and/or ‘amodimethicone’, basically anything with ingredients ending in ‘*cone’ Silicones are added to many commercial shampoo and conditioners to add shine and to help smooth the hair. They also build up on the hair shaft, resulting in dirty, oily and lifeless looking hair. As they coat the hair, silicones also prevent moisture benefitting the hair shaft and scalp, especially during the all-important cleansing process.

Rubber gloves can be made out of natural rubber or Synthetic rubber.
🌱
The term 'rubber' refers to durable, waterproof and elastic material made from natural or synthetic latex.
🌱
So, how do you know you're making a sustainable choice? Look for gloves made from 100% FSC certified rubber. This means the rubber meets rigorous standards for sustainable forest sourcing. You can also rest assured that the gloves can be composted once they've lived their life. Here's the best tip: they will break down if cut up before adding to the compost, or you can even leave them in the sun to harden and crumble over time, which makes for a fun experiment with the kids!

Hydration is always a good idea... Lots of water consumed daily will not only keep your skin well hydrated, it will also flush out any toxins or nasties in your system.

Without enough water, your skin can dry out and flake. Opt for filtered or spring water where possible. If you find you would like a little flavour, the odd herbal tea (without milk) here and there will also count towards your daily water intake.

Whilst we can’t promise that adopting all of these strategies will completely eradicate your dandruff, we can assure you that you will see some improvements not only with the flakes, but your overall holistic wellbeing.

🌱
Whilst there hasn't been any scientific research into Autumn shedding, it has been confirmed by dermatologists that a seasonal shedding of hair is in fact, a thing!
🌱
If you have noticed your hair is shedding, here are a few tips to support you.
🌱Reduce your heat styling. Especially straighteners and tongs. This can damage the hair shaft and leave it feeling weak. 
🌱For those with long hair, ditch the rubber band, opt for scrunchies or fabric ties, which will not grab the hair and pull it from the scalp when styling. 
🌱Shampoo Less, Condition More. The additional hydration of the scalp will nourish your hair down to the roots, strengthening the hair that remains. This is a great time to try the NEW (and three times award winning) Super Rich Conditioner which is loaded with the goodness of Organic Argan Oil and Rapeseed (Canola) Oil to support dry hair which is prone to breakage.

Called Co-Washing, (also known as the ‘no-poo’ method and ‘conditioner only’) this method of washing your hair uses only conditioner, no shampoo. The goal of co-washing is to deeply hydrate and moisturise the hair, reducing the chance of stripping the hair of its natural oils and moisture which leaves it prone to breakage.

Omitting Shampoo omits the process of washing out the important natural oils, giving it a better chance to rejuvenate and strengthen.

nuebar,"Did you know that one of the causes of dandruff is from a reaction to harsh chemicals in hair products?
🌱
The skin is the largest organ in your body. The application of chemicals to the hair (and therefore the skin), especially when they aren’t washed out (such as styling products), can result in skin irritation and therefore flaky scalp.
🌱
This can also be the case if you are not washing the shampoo or conditioner properly from your hair on hair-wash day. When choosing hair products, opt for those that are: 
• chemical free,
• free of soaps, sulphates, silicones, parabens
• free of drying ethanol-based alcohols
🌱
Being a naturopath formulated brand, NueBar is free of all of these additives, instead we choose the best that nature can provide in plant-based, chemical free organic rich ingredients.

Bubbly and foam based body cleansers and soaps often contain chemicals to make the bubbles, bubblier.
🌱
Whilst bubbles can be fun, it can also strip the natural oils from your children's delicate skin.
🌱
Our body wash bars are not soap. Naturopath formulated with the best that green chemistry can offer (thats a fancy term for consciously made skincare) NueBar Body bars work with the skin's natural oils, in an effort to replenish, rather than wash away.
🌱
Using cleansing ingredients provided by Mother Nature such as clay, cocao butter and organic essential oils, you can choose a wash bar to suit your (and your children's) needs. The added bonus is in teaching them about the significance of #plasticfree, supporting a new generation of eco-consciousness to emerge.

Did you know that the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of conventional fossil fuel-based plastics is forecast to grow to 19 per cent of the global carbon budget by 2040? That's pretty scary! Especially when some 98 per cent of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel, or ""virgin"" feedstock.

🌱
Naturopath formulated, the range is scented using pure (and organic where possible) essential oils and the earth derived ingredients from which they are made.
🌱
The essential oils we have selected are designed to soothe and offer anti-inflammatory and cleansing properties such as Pink Grapefruit, Orange, Ylang Ylang and Lavender. Of course in choosing these scents, we also seek to ensure the range is suitable for the whole family, Mum, Dad, Brothers, Sisters and of course Grandparents.
🌱
For those extra sensitive customers, we even have a range especially for YOU! The fragrance free range has zero essential oils added, as we know that some people prefer to go without for their own reasons :)

We say YES! Not only do plants look great, but these living organism are making it their life's purpose to reduce excess moisture (and air-born toxins) in your bathroom.

nuebar,"What are Parabens and why should you avoid them?
🌱
Parabens are a preservative of sorts, synthetic chemicals designed to make the shelf life of hair and skin care products longer, especially those containing water (hello bottled shampoo and conditioner).
🌱
Scientific studies have raised concerns that parabens are not only responsible for some skin irritations (especially on sensitive skin), but that prolonged exposure through skin absorption, can disrupt hormones, particularly in adolescent girls and women, effecting fertility and reproductive organs, birth outcomes and even increase the risk of cancer.
🌱
In fact, new scientific data has confirmed that parabens can spur the growth of certain types of breast cancer cells.
🌱
With NueBar being a Naturopath formulated concentrated bar (rather than liquid), we have been able to do away with Parabens. In fact, your wellbeing is our priority in the formulation of our products, which is why we choose to hand pour our products, rather than machine make for mass production.
🌱
We like to call it 'slow-made', because we know slow and considered is better for you and better for our beautiful Mother Earth.

nuebar,"Why is Organic Olive Oil infused with Calendula flowers a key ingredient in our Shampoo Oily?
🌱
The purpose of Oily hair shampoo is all about creating balance to the scalp. Over production of oil occurs when the scalp attempts to rebalance the production of sebum, the skin's natural oils. This can be as a result of hormonal imbalance, genetics or ethnicity ... or excess washing, leaving product residue behind after washing or using the wrong products in your hair (especially those laden with chemicals).
🌱
Olive Oil supports the scalp by unclogging hair follicles, acting as an anti fungal and by balancing dandruff production.
🌱
Calendula Oil (one of our favourite ingredients here at HQ) is rich in antioxidants, not only offering support in regenerating and encouraging follicle growth, but also strengthens collagen production and blood circulation - all qualities that help restore balance to your scalp and the oil in your hair.

Most soap bars require certain hardeners for mass production by machines. These hardeners can be irritating (particularly for sensitive skin) or even leave a residue on your hair. By hand pouring your NueBars, we can ensure the formula is softer and more gentle on your skin and hair.

With more human power, and less electrical power, hand pouring is also better for the environment. This is why we say, NueBar is ‘Better for you, better for Mother Earth’.

nuebar,"One of our favourite ingredients in the Oily Face bar is Neem oil.
🌱
Derived from the seeds of the neem tree, this wonder ingredient has been used in traditional medicine for various skin conditions, including acne, due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Neem oil contains compounds such as azadirachtin, nimbin, and nimbidin, which have strong antibacterial properties which help to balance acne-causing bacteria on the skin.
🌱
The anti-inflammatory properties contained in Neem oil can also help reduce redness, swelling, and irritation associated with acne. Inflammation is a key factor in the development and exacerbation of acne lesions. Finally, Neem oil can also be helpful with regulating sebum (oil) production, which is a common factor in the development of acne as it prevents pores from becoming clogged, reducing the likelihood of acne formation.

nuebar,"Are plant derivatives enough for your skincare routine?
🌱
The best way to look at this question is to consider the alternatives. If we were to look at chemical alternatives, this becomes a very simple answer. Being Natural, plant based ingredients are less likely to cause adverse reactions than their chemical counterparts, this makes them a wiser choice for sensitive skin in particular.
🌱
Being a gentler alternative, plant based ingredients are also less likely to strip the skin of its natural oils.
🌱
Finally, as they are jam packed with naturally occurring antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, natural antiseptic, vitamins and minerals, just like our naturally produced foods, plant based ingredients are all you really need to heal your skin!
🌱
So, if this is true, why do they make skincare products from chemical based alternatives? Well truthfully, profit. Generally man made chemicals have been produced as they are less expensive to produce, or the production has been one which provides profit to the organisation making it.
🌱
When you consider the adverse effects of chemicals on your skin, the balance of investment far outweighs the cost.

Chanelle is in her final months of studying Naturopathy. Whilst in India, her skin broke out after indulging in a little bit too much dairy (we get it, we suffer with skin reactions to dairy too). So, she went to work straight away on adopting a holistic routine to heal it. As well as eating a diet of anti-inflammatory, phytonutrient rich wholefoods in every meal and drinking 2.5 litres of filtered water every day, swimming in the ocean and taking charge of her mindfulness routine by listening to her own intuitive needs...

Chanelle chose NueBar Facewash Oily to cleanse her face during this important period restoring her skin. ... and the results were phenomenal.

Why were we extra excited? Well, as Chanelle is just a few months shy of being a fully qualified Naturopath, she is at the forefront of her own Health and Wellness journey. The fact that she chose NueBar to join her on her healing journey affirmed for us that we're on the right path in sharing our Naturopath formulated range with the world... and of course, we LOVE seeing results.

🌱 Whilst you sleep the friction from the cotton pillowcase can also weaken the strands of hair. 
🌱 The texture of the pillow case may stretch the hair as you sleep, when the hair is particularly dry it becomes weak and brittle, and will break off.
🌱 Instead, opt for a silk style pillow case, which is less prone to wicking and softer on your head and your hair.

nuebar,"Oily Hair? Silicone is not your friend!
🌱
Choosing products that are Silicone Free is important when managing Oily hair.
🌱
Look out for products detailing ingredients such as ‘dimethicone’, ‘cyclomethicone’ and/or ‘amodimethicone’, basically anything with ingredients ending in ‘*cone’ Silicones are added to many commercial shampoo and conditioners to add shine and to help smooth the hair. They also build up on the hair shaft, resulting in dirty, oily and lifeless looking hair. As they coat the hair, silicones also prevent moisture benefitting the hair shaft and scalp, especially during the all-important cleansing process.

🌱
Remember small steps = big change.
🌱
Here's a few tips to remember when making the switch.
1. Don't look at the project as an 'all at once' mission. Rather make the commitment towards small steps, one at a time. This week may be shampoo, next week (or fortnight) may be water bottles, the following product bags.
2. Make it count! Often we don't realise how much change we have made until we sit down and calculate the positives. Pour a cup of tea and write down a list of how you saved plastic this week and what you can do next week. Again, one small step leads to many in time, be gentle with yourself, too many ideas can be overwhelming so keep it short and sweet.
3. Strike up a conversation! Two heads are better than one. When you strike up a conversation about your efforts to save plastic, you may find your friend/s have tips to share with you in what's working for them in making the switch... and vice versa.

🌱
Today we spill the beans on a washing method that offers a more nourishing, moisturising and restorative method to support your hair!
🌱
Called Co-Washing, (also known as the ‘no-poo’ method and ‘conditioner only’) this method of washing your hair uses only conditioner, no shampoo. The goal of co-washing is to deeply hydrate and moisturise the hair, reducing the chance of stripping the hair of its natural oils and moisture which leaves it prone to breakage.
🌱
Omitting Shampoo omits the process of washing out the important natural oils, giving it a better chance to rejuvenate and strengthen.
🌱
The process is simple, every other 'shampoo day' ditch the shampoo and condition only. You can read about the benefits of cowashing on our blog, link via the bio.

The process is really quite simple, and if you don't succeed the first time, well, just try again.
🌱
You can use a simple coat hanger as the base, bend it around a round bucket or paint tin to get the circular shape.
🌱
Then, bundle foraged eucalyptus or pine, into small bunches, approx 3-4 stems per bunch, tie off using twine.
🌱
Once you have say, 10 small bunches, start to tie them onto the ring.
🌱
You may need more bunches as you go.
🌱
You can add some colour with dried orange slices or dried flowers kept from yesteryear, again, tying them on with twine.
🌱
Then, use a ribbon or twine to create a loop which you hang to the front door and away you go!

Reduce your wash days (and stop using soap)! Whilst this may seem odd, too much washing can upset the balance of your scalp, simply resulting in an over production of oil, to compensate that which has been stripped from your scalp.

Here's another idea: Ditch the soap! Commercial, soapy, bubble rich shampoos can be full of chemicals, which strip the natural oils from your hair, once again resulting in an over production of oil whilst the scalp attempts to balance itself.

How frequently should you wash? Well, ideally every 2-3 days using a very mild shampoo. NueBar is soap free, non-stripping and non-drying.

🌿
‘And guys, honestly I’ve tried and tested! This “Co-Washing” technique it’s the bomb! I’ll be adding to my weekly routine from now on! @nuebar_australia 
🌿
I was worried as my hair is fine and I thought perhaps it would end up greasy, oily looking. But it didn’t. It was soft, refreshed and still had body!
🌿
Generally when I wash with Shampoo it’s limp, flat, lifeless.
🌿
So wow oh wow, I was stoked to find another method, where it’s good for the environment and for me!
🌿
The super-rich conditioner has been formulated by Naturopath, Katie Hennah for those with curly hair and also those with dry hair, which may be damaged from excess bleaching, colouring, heat styling, chemical treatments or like me, the sun as I spend so much time in the ocean ;)
🌿
This product is also well suited for those who are adopting the ‘No Poo’, ‘Co-Washing’ or ‘Conditioner Only Washing’ Method.
🌿
Made from Highly nutritive, superior conditioning ingredients including Rapeseed Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Olive Oil fractions and Vitamin B5 which absorb into the hair shaft, nourishing it as opposed to coating it, leaving it naturally shiny and healthy without the extra weight or the need for silicones as found in other conditioners.
🌿
The conditioning agents in the super rich conditioner bar change the hair shaft from negative to positively charged, causing the cuticle to lie flat, reducing tangling and breakage, which makes it perfect in supporting those with dry, frizzy, curly or damaged hair from styling.
