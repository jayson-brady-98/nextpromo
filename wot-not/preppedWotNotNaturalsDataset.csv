I am using the SPF 40+ BB Cream from @wotnotnaturals this is the world’s first reef friendly High SPF + collagen serum + Antioxidant mineral makeup. 

I love that it has added sun protection for my face. It’s super easy to blend as you can see here which is great for me as it makes my morning routine super quick. 

Do you use a BB cream?

All Wotnot sunscreens contain no harsh chemicals, and they fully disclose all ingredients on pack for full transparency. 
All their products have also been given the tick from the Eczema Association which was also a big concern for us for Saynt’s skin.

wot not naturals,"Do you know what's in your sunscreen?

Dermatologists agree that sunscreen is the number 1 anti-aging cream and you should use it every day no matter the season. 

But what is the difference between mineral/natural/physical vs chemical sunscreen?

A mineral sunscreen uses minerals as its active ingredients. The minerals most often used are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Both of these ingredients occur naturally, although they can also be created synthetically.

Mineral sunscreens are sometimes called physical sunscreens because they provide a physical barrier between your skin and the sun’s rays. Think of these minerals as millions of tiny mirrors resting on the surface of your skin, bouncing away harmful UV rays! 

Chemical sunscreens penetrate your skin and use synthetic compounds like oxybenzone, octisalate, avobenzone and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, to create a chemical reaction in your skin. This reaction transforms the UV rays from the sun into heat and is released into the air.

wot not naturals,"“Should you wear sunscreen every day?”🧴 

We get this question a lot and the short answer is yes, absolutely! 

There is a common misconception that sunscreen only needs to be applied on warm summer days, or if you’re spending the day at the beach. While UVB levels (associated with skin burning) are generally higher during the summer, UVA light (associated with skin aging) is present all year-round, even on cloudy, overcast days. Small amounts of sun-damage add up over time, which is why it’s best to develop a habit of applying SPF each and every day!

Our SPF 40 Natural Face Sunscreen protects against UVA and UVB rays, doubling as a Mineral Makeup and BB Cream. 😎

wot not naturals,"3 TIPS ON CARING FOR YOUR BABY’S FEET🦶🏽

Although babies have their own funny way of communicating, chances are they won’t be able to tell you that their feet are cold. From heal to toe, here are 3 quick and easy tips on looking after your little ones feet.

1️⃣ KEEP THEM COSY

In cooler conditions, it’s important to keep your baby’s feet toasty warm. Avoid tight-fitting socks that restrict movement or loose-fitting socks that can slide off. Instead, opt for a onesie that covers their feet and keeps them cosy. 

2️⃣ KEEP THEM CLEAN

While it’s not often you see babies playing Saturday sport, their feet can still get quite grubby. Aim to wash your little ones feet regularly, at least once a day, and dry with a soft towel (especially between those tiny toes).

3️⃣ WATCH OUT FOR OUCHIES

Keep an eye out for small cuts, blisters or dry skin. Regularly inspect your baby’s feet (perhaps after a nappy change) and give them a gentle clean with one of our all natural baby wipes.

They make our day to day lives easier; from wiping up the spills of little ones to quickly removing a face of makeup when you just want to flop into bed.  There are many handy uses for wipes and we understand, in the modern day, convenience is king. However, many of us still want to be conscious of throw away culture! It is Plastic Free July after-all. 🌏

Luck for you is that Wotnot’s natural face wipes and baby wipes are made from the fastest-growing fibre in the world: BAMBOO. Which means they are 100% natural and COMPOSTABLE. You can put our wipes straight in your compost or normal bin and they will breakdown into natural fibres! (not just biodegrade into little plastic bits like so many others do!). How good is that! 🌱

🌤️ Ultraviolet A (UVA) has a longer wavelength, and  is associated with skin aging.

🌤️ Ultraviolet B (UVB) has a shorter wavelength and is associated with skin burning.

🌤️ While UVA and UVB rays differ in how they affect the skin, they both do harm. Both types of UV light are proven to contribute to the risk for skin cancer!

🌤️ Even if it looks overcast outside, don’t be fooled! Up to 80% of the sun’s rays can still penetrate cloud cover and even worse, reflect off it.

🌤️ Look for a sunscreen that protects against both types of rays.

wot not naturals,"Newborn Bath time with a midwife @goldenandwilde_ 

Bath time can be a beautiful time to bond with baby and help calm them in the evenings.It is also a great time to incorporate tummy time & baby massage. Prior to your discharge or at your home visit your midwife will show you the ropes of baby bathing.
Babies are born covered in vernix “birthday frosting”. A waxy substance full of protein and water that protects delicate newborn skin. We suggest to not wash this off and allow the skin to absorb it. Therefore, We recommend delaying bathing your baby until at least 48-72hours post delivery or even longer.

Here are a midwives tips & tricks for bath time:

💫Have everything you need ready! @bunniecaddie is perfect for this!

💫cotton buds to wipe each eye with water from the inner eye out. Baby eyes can get a wee bit gunky!

💫Two Towels, one for drying and a smaller hand towel and to drape over baby’s arms and belly. This calms them and decreases their reflexes disturbing them less.

💫Baby wash, this is totally personal if you wish to use products. We recommend fragrance free, natural and no nut oils. Goldie loves wot not natural baby wash!

💫 Cord care, keeping cord nice and dry after a bath is easily achieved with a cotton tip. Clean around the cord, the cord will dry out and drop off within 2 weeks. Bath time is also a great time to monitor for any signs of infection. You do not need use betadine or antiseptic creams.

💫nappies, wipes and an outfit.

Always wash babies hair first, wrap them in a towel & wash their hair over the bath. Babies lose a lot of heat from their heads so drying up their hair before placing them back in the bath is a must.

Ideal bath temp is between 37-38degrees. A deep bath is even more relaxing for bub.

Bath water with natural products can be tipped into your garden (the perks of a portable tub).

wot not naturals,"Tips for removing your natural sunscreen 💁 :

☀️ Wotnot sunscreen is a physical (zinc based) sunscreen and the base consists of oil, so it doesn’t always wash off as easily as a chemical sunscreen. (This is a good thing!)

☀️ Zinc sunscreen is easy to remove with an oil cleanser. You can use coconut oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, even olive oil works. (Pour a little into the palm of your hand, then massage it all over your face. Leave it to soak in for a minute or two. Rinse off or use a face washer.)

☀️ Try our wipes! Wotnot face wipes are infused with certified organic oils that work really well to remove zinc based sunscreens. Use one wipe to remove all sunscreen and makeup before using your everyday cleanser, if double cleansing is your thing! 😉 They are also certified compostable, so you can just pop them in your compost bin when you’re done! 🌿

wot not naturals,"Spring is here, so it’s time to restock the sunscreen! ☀️ Mineral vs Chemical sunscreen. Do you know the difference?
☀️
A mineral sunscreen is just what it sounds like—a sunscreen that uses minerals as its active ingredients. The minerals most often used are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Both of these ingredients occur naturally, although they can also be created synthetically. 
☀️
Mineral sunscreens are sometimes called physical sunscreens because they provide a physical barrier between your skin and the sun’s rays. Think of these minerals as millions of tiny mirrors resting on the surface of your skin, bouncing away harmful UV rays! 😊 
☀️
Chemical sunscreens penetrate your skin and use synthetic compounds to create a chemical reaction in our skin. This reaction transform the UV rays from the sun into heat and is released into the air. However! there is an ongoing debate about sunscreen ingredients, specifically chemical UV actives and their effect on our bodies and the reefs! 😬

wot not naturals,"For all you new mummies 💗 Repost @clairefalconer__  Having a baby has been one of the biggest learning curves of my life. Every day I’m learning and growing. Here are my top things I’ve learnt from having a newborn:
- Burp baby often (definitely didn’t do this enough, especially in the early days)
- They feed, then 5 min later they are starving again and yes that is totally normal and in fact he was boosting my supply. It wasn’t that I had “low” supply
- Buy tonnes of little towels, baby’s vom (a lot) well mine did at least (prob because I wasn’t burping him enough 😜)
- Accept any and all help
- Newborns sleep bloody loud, they are very noisy. I woke Beau so many times in the early days thinking he was hungry or wanted a hug. Nope just sleeping and making so many noises 😂
- You seriously don’t need many clothes at all. They grow so so quick, don’t waste your money.
- Buy sleeping bag swaddles, not muslin cloth swaddles, after the hundredth time waking up during the night the last thing you want to do is unwrap and re wrap baby. I just wanted to zip him up.
- They will suck absolutely anything thinking it’s a nipple 😂 dads hairy chest, your chin, nose. You name it.
- Babys hate sleeping on anything but a person. Just embrace it, enjoy those contact naps..
- In those early days don’t even bother trying to get bub into a routine or sleep train them. Newborns are on their own schedule.
- Take tonnes of pics and videos, they grow so quick.
- Anyone that tells you “sleep when baby sleeps” don’t listen, don’t get yourself upset in comparing yourself to others. The min you put your head down your bub wakes. I say the best advice is that every single mum is also massively sleep deprived. All babies are the same, and yours is not uniquely “bad” at sleeping, it is developmentally normal for them to wake often and feed often.
- You will just stare at them for hours & hours & hours. Don’t even attempt to be productive at anything else.
- It’s not all rainbows and sunshine, mumma hood is hard and that’s okay. Women are superhero’s.

Obviously all these are super relevant to me. These may not apply to you or your bub. Tell me what you learnt about having a newborn ??",13-09-2021,0,,,0,61,9,https://www.instagram.com/p/CTxdR3IrfY1/,
wot not naturals,"What's the #1 thing you can do to help avoid ageing skin? Wear SPF! 
.
Use a daily sunscreen like Wotnot Natural Face Sunscreen and Primer to protect you skin against ageing sun damage. Our unique formula is perfect for everyday use. It's lightweight, rubs in easily and doesn't leave behind a white cast, making it ideal for use under makeup. Plus the clever inclusion of COSMOS approved plant collagen helps minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 😉

wot not naturals,"Spring is here, and most of us can't wait to get back on the beach, but it's important to remember the sun is still super strong, so we don't want to forget our anti-ageing suncare! We thought we'd go back to basics are answer the common question 'What Does SPF Actually Mean?'🌞
.
SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor. SPF numbers are an approximate indication of how much protection from the sun a product will provide for your skin. Everyone’s skin is different and each person’s skin can be exposed to the sun for different lengths of time before burning. Sunscreen extends the time before burning by a multiple of the SPF. For example, if you have fair skin and would normally burn in 5 minutes without any sun protection then an SPF 30 will give you 30 x 5 minutes protection.
.
However! No sunscreen provides total protection and will rub off over time, so it's super important to reapply regularly and cover up especially during the hottest part of the day..
.
Enjoy the sunshine (Safely) beauties!

wot not naturals,"Spring is here, so it’s time to restock the sunscreen! ☀️Mineral vs Chemical sunscreen. Do you know the difference?
☀️
 A mineral sunscreen is just what it sounds like—a sunscreen that uses minerals as its active ingredients. The minerals most often used are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Both of these ingredients occur naturally, although they can also be created synthetically.
☀️
Mineral sunscreens work in a completely different way to chemical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens penetrate your skin and offer protection by dissipating UV rays. By contrast, mineral sunscreens simply sit on top of your skin and reflect UV rays away from your body.
☀️
Mineral sunscreens are sometimes called physical sunscreens because they provide a physical barrier between your skin and the sun’s rays. Think of these minerals as millions of tiny mirrors resting on the surface of your skin, bouncing away harmful UV rays!😊 #sunsafe #SPF #Sunscreen #OrganicSuncare #NaturalSunscreen",09-09-2021,0,,,0,11,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CTljEuvNmnL/,

wot not naturals,"Motherhood for me has been...
Routine.
Forgetting why I walked into rooms.
Plastic shiny eye sores all around the house.
A constant headache from wearing my hair up.
Forgiving myself, time and time again.
Food wastage, a lot of it.
Trying to remember to make time for the animals.
Calling my pets “the animals”.
Understanding what free the nip really means.
Forgetting what my table looks like underneath washing piles.
Nodding in agreeance when someone says “cheers to the freaken weekend”, but actually that means nothing to me.
When shaving my legs becomes an achievement of what I got done today.
Routine.
Saving on shampoo and conditioner but spending up on dry shampoo.
Constantly seeing my iPhone storage is full from baby spam.
Online shopping.
Bay- Bee Shark do doo do do... (I know you sung that in your head).
Developing a new walk when the baby has just fallen asleep, I like to call it ‘the creep walk’.
Laughing about nothing
Crying about nothing.
Wondering how basic hygiene, like having a shower is considered ‘me time’.
Struggling to make conversation with hubby about anything not baby related.
Not thinking about my outfit anymore because... leggings.
Discovering new friendships, ones I know I’ll have for life.
Struggling to find balance.
Fantasising about sleep yet trying to get my babies to sleep who don’t want to sleep.
Coming to terms with expectations vs reality.
Feeling like a human jungle gym.
Routine.
Coffee, strong cold coffee.
Thinking about child friendly cafes as opposed to bars.
Not recognising my face under my eyebrow overtake.
To do lists that only get longer.
Messages left on read for hours, sometimes days at a time.
Remembering not to compare and trust my instincts as a new mother.
Broken conversations, or ones crammed into 30 seconds.
Loving, so much it hurts.
Guilt, over anything.
Questions, so many questions, a lot of it about texture of poo.
Routine, did I mention?
But embracing it all, sometimes not with open arms, but embracing it.
Through beauty and chaos.

wot not naturals,"""I think one of the hardest things about having a colicky baby (or two 🥴) is that there is an idea perpetuated about motherhood that it’s instinctual and natural, that moments after giving birth we will suddenly and magically have “mother’s intuition” and will always know what our baby needs the second that they need it.
•
It often feels like our Number One Job as a mother is to care for and comfort our baby, so when we end up with a baby who doesn’t take comfort in our care or closeness it can feel like we’re just a big fat failure or that we’re not a natural mother. Mamas, this is not the case!
•
Babies will be babies. They don’t always stop crying when we hold them and they don’t always calm down when they know that we are close. There are myriad reasons why your baby might be upset but you being a failure is not one of them, I promise.
•
One of the most important things I’ve learned after having three babes in four years is to just trust that I’m enough. That my love is enough, my attention is enough, the food that I’m providing is enough, the way that I parent is enough. If I could give every new mother a gift it would be the knowledge that they are enough, but of course the catch is that the knowledge that we’re the very best parent for our child sometimes only comes after we’ve done it once or twice.
•
Colic mamas, medical mamas, working mamas, stay at home mamas, home-schooling mamas, any regular old mamas, and dads: you are enough! This shit is all trial-and-error and our kiddos are all gonna be just fine.""

Choosing natural and organic self-tanning lotions means that you not only get a safe tan but also all the benefits or nourishing organics extracts while your tan develops. Our new look self-tanners are rich in botanical ingredients from Australia that are good for your skin, such as Kakadu Plum extract.

Australian Kakadu Plum is the world’s richest source of the most stable natural Vitamin C (70 times greater than orange) which means it holds its nutrient value for much longer. Vitamin C is essential for glowing skin; it helps to firm skin, fade dark spots and acne scarring, and improves the way skin responds to UV light. Vitamin C aids wrinkle reduction; increases collagen synthesis; aids the reduction of hyperpigmentation, resulting in the enhancement of skin brightness, radiance, and luminosity, as it naturally lightens the complexion and improves elasticity of the skin.

Here at Wotnot, our two founders were eager to create natural sunscreen products for the whole family. As a result, we researched earth-friendly ingredients to find out what will best protect you from harmful UVA and UVB rays, and discovered that zinc oxide is the ideal active component. Instead of soaking up the rays, like chemical UV actives, zinc oxide reflects these harmful rays.

Our formulas are free from GMOs, sulphates, petrochemicals, parabens, artificial preservatives or fragrances. They're perfect for sensitive skin and can be used on babies as young as 3 months. They're also Eczema Association approved - win win! 👌

Our high-protection natural sunscreen is also award winning, so it's considered one of the best in the country. If you're looking for trustworthy organic sunscreen in Australia, you can’t go wrong with our expertly manufactured formulas at Wotnot. 😎

My son is currently teething and his poor little private parts look like they are in a world of pain! Once applying this nappy rash cream it’s magically improved his little bottom dramatically - this nappy rash cream is amazing best one I’ve ever used! X

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Amazing!
My partner uses this cream for dry skin areas during winter and now I use it too, such good ingredients please never change the formulation! One of the best natural brands around.

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Not just for babies!
Bought the baby balm a few days ago as I was looking for an organic non-toxic moisturiser for myself, I absolutely love it my skin is so much softer and the ingredients are the cleanest I’ve seen yet, such a great product :)

wot not naturals,"9 tips for being a more lighthearted mama! 😚
Let's face it, times are tough right now and for some, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We found these helpful tips on getting through the daily grind with young kids with a sense of humour and coming out the other side with your sanity! 😘👌

1. Laugh! At least once a day, make each child fall over with laughter.

2. Sing in the morning. It's hard both to sing and to be cranky!

3. Ensure you are getting enough sleep.

4. Most messages we say to our kids are negative: ""stop"", ""don't"", ""no"". Try saying ""yes"". ""Yes, we'll go as soon as you've finished eating or tidying up your room"".

5. Say ""no"" only when it really matters. ""Mum, I want to wear my bright red shirt with bright orange shorts"". Sure why not! 😀

6. Use school mantras: ""Sit square in your chair"". ""You get what you get and you don't get upset"" and ""Don't yuck my yum"".

7. Give yourself plenty of time to get where you are going. This can save you alot of stress!

8. Try to make it fun to get the job done: let's race to see who can get dressed fastest, who can break the record on cleaning the kitchen, turn chores into scenes from a play.

9. And lastly, always remember: The age of crayons and the Tooth Fairy is fleeting. The days are long but the years are short. 😄

This month we host a series of talks with experienced midwife of 10 years and mum of two boys, Sarah Tooke who runs Sarah Tooke Childbirth & Parenting Education classes. Her aim is to empower expecting mums with the knowledge to have a positive childbirth experience and eliminate the fear that many new parents have about what's to come. 👶

Wotnot all natural face wipes are made with certified organic ingredients like rosehip and aloe vera. These reduce inflammation and soothe the skin, and contain antioxidants to fight off free radicals to keep skin looking young and fresh! 🌸🌸🌸
Our face wipes are safe to use on and around your eyes and remove waterproof mascara using just 1 wipe! Plus they’re 100% biodegradable and compostable so you can help our planet as well! 🍃🌏✅

Wearing sunscreen daily protects the skin from the sun's harmful, damage-causing UV rays that result in long-lasting skin damage like sunspots, fine lines and wrinkles ☀️☀️☀️
SPF is one of the best and easiest routes to having younger looking skin for longer. Aim for at least SPF 30 as this blocks out 97% of the sun's harmful rays ☀️☀️☀️

This was our first time and I put my trust in the supermums who are behind this range. I have to say, we’re both converted! 😍 👌

wot not naturals,"Why wearing sunscreen, even on a cloudy day, is your best protection against the wintertime sun 😎🌞

It’s standard that your summertime skin care routine will change as you head into winter. But one product you shouldn’t skip out on is sunscreen. 

Some time in the winter sun will give you a boost of vitamin D which can help the skin repair itself and is proven to help even if you have a condition like eczema. Not wearing sunscreen though will make your skin worse and cause it to dry out even more.

Our SPF30 Natural Sunscreen was initially formulated to not only protect from the sun but also to treat eczema. ✅ 👌 Featuring certified organic ingredients, this sunscreen has a beautiful texture, is deeply moisturising and is made for people with sensitive skin. 

It’s become a go-to product for eczema sufferers as it helps people manage their condition effectively without any harsh, toxic chemicals and with no side effects. 

Looking after your skin in winter may sound like a chore, but once you create a daily habit of it, your skin will be glowing radiantly rather than beaming red from being itchy and raw. As always, drink lots of water in winter, avoid rapid changes in temperature and use skin care products that are natural and nourishing for your skin. 😊

Approved by the Eczema Association for use with the most sensitive skin, including eczema, rosacea and psoriasis. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐""So glad I found this! This is my go-to cream for all things toddler/baby. It goes on really smoothly and glides over the affected area unlike some other baby/nappy rash creams. Perfect so that it doesn’t irritate the already sensitive skin.

They’re perfect for removing daily impurities, make-up and waterproof mascara, cleansing gently without causing irritation, they feel luxuriously soft on your skin and make you feel amazing afterwards.❤️ But why use ours?

Each of our facial cleansing wipes is as close to nature as possible. On a daily basis, we expose our skin to pollutants, which then turn into free radicals. When free radicals are left to run loose, they accelerate the ageing process.

At Wotnot, our organic cleansing wipes feature a range of ingredients that tackle free radicals. These include: 💚Aloe vera. Aloe vera reduces inflammation and soothes the skin.
💚Rosehip oil. Rosehip oil contains lots of Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant that fights free radicals to keep your skin looking young and fresh.
💚Organic sweet almond oil. Organic sweet almond oil gently exfoliates your skin, removing the dead layers above and encouraging new layers to grow.

It connects is with the outdoors and the gentle satisfaction of watching things grow brings a unique calmness and positivity. 😚🌿 If you've no garden, there are plenty of ways to grow indoors.
You'll need a sunny windowsill, inside or out. For beginners, herbs are a great one to start with. They're easy to plant and manage, plus they're immune boosting and delicious! - and when supermarket supplies are low they become increasingly worthwhile. You can use the trays that tomatoes and mushrooms come in - just make some holes in the bottom for drainage.

With so many families around the world affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), these are unsettling times. Social distancing has become a reality, especially for those who have children with underlying health issues, elderly relatives or compromised immune systems. It is a time to prioritise your health and safety and that of your family and friends.
Give your children space to share any fears they might have, but also try to make any extra time at home together fun. Read books together, watch movies, dance, bake, get creative, play hide-and-seek. Show your children they are safe and loved. Try to find some downtime for yourself too: put your feet up with a good book or magazine and make time to relax.

These are challenging times for us all. Above all, please let's be kind to others and stay safe. 📷via @allherflowers

wot not naturals,"Confused about the difference between a SPF30 and SPF50 sunscreen?

While SPF 50 sounds like a significantly higher level of protection than an SPF30 the difference is not really in the amount of UV protection. An SPF50 sunscreen will filter 98% of UV radiation while an SPF30 product filters 96.7% so the difference is not large. The difference is around the length of time that it will protect you but there are issues with this.

Everyone’s skin is different and each person’s skin can be exposed to the sun for different lengths of time before burning. Sunscreen extends the time before burning by a multiple of the SPF. Eg if you have fair skin and would normally burn in 5 minutes without any sun protection then an SPF 30 will give you 30 x 5 minutes protection. The issue is that all sunscreens will rub off over time with normal activity and perspiration and so in some cases the higher SPF can give a false sense of security. Due to normal activity all sunscreens need to be reapplied regularly.

Protect your skin today the natural way 😉 🌞😎 #naturalsunscreen #spf30 #nonasties #skincancer #protectyourskin",18-02-2020,0,,,0,34,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8r_kh8CqNm/,

wot not naturals,"Summer is in full swing and you know that it isn’t safe to lie in the sun anymore with these harsh UV rays. 
However simply using a self-tan on the skin is not that simple or healthy. As our skins absorbs 70% of what is being placed on it, its hard to not be fearful of the amount of chemicals that come from self-tanners, especially because we don’t know the long-term effects yet.

Non-natural tanning may contain harmful ingredients including dyes, fragrances, alcohol, parabens, petrochemicals and harsh synthetics which can then cause reactions and hormone disruptions.

Natural Tanning such as Wotnot Self-Tan lotion uses Australian certified organic Kakadu plum and camellia oil to provide antioxidants and nutrients to help the colour development whilst the organic aloe very moisturises and soothes to have the tan fade naturally.

The DHA in natural tan should be COSMOS approved and be non-synthetic. The Wotnot Self tan uses sugar cane DHA, this reacts to the proteins and amino acids in the outer layers of the skin.

Natural tanning is the only way to have a healthy tan.

Then stop using it right now.

Sun protection is a way of life for every Australian.

And there are many options on the market right now to do this…… lotions, creams, balms and even sticks.

But why do we have aerosol sunscreens? And WHY do we allow companies to market these products to children?

The simple truth is that most aerosol sunscreens contain a cocktail of toxic and flammable chemicals that have no place being near your skin or your family's.

To learn more about the risks of aerosol sunscreens and how you can stay protected this summer, read our latest blog post.

wot not naturals,"The most common ingredient used in self-tanning solutions is dihydroxyacetone (DHA), but as with any ingredient it comes in lots of different grades.  Natural fake tans which are COSMOS certified use DHA derived from natural ingredients, such as sugar cane. This DHA is designed to react to the proteins and amino acids in the outer layers of the skin. Products with synthetic based DHA include chemical absorbers designed to penetrate the skin’s surface to develop a faster tan.  These tans can also contain ingredients like dyes, artificial fragrances, parabens, alcohol and petrochemicals. The side effect of the absorbers used to develop synthetic based tanning lotions, is that all the products chemicals are more easily absorbed into the blood stream.

COSMOS certified organic tanning lotions contain only natural, approved ingredients which are selected to benefit the skin.  This means that while the tan develops the skin is nourished and naturally hydrated giving it a healthy, natural glow ☀️ #skinneverforgets #wotsnottolove",30-08-2018,0,,,0,200,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/BnGbcZugfpH/,

At Wotnot we know it’s cool to be kind to our planet and we take this job very seriously. From being conscious of the waste generated in a standard office on a daily basis (always reuse first!), to creative up-cycling (our empty tape rolls end up in childcare centres and local playgroups to be used for craft), we aim to minimise environmental impact. If it can’t be re-used, we recycle and likewise we source recycled materials for our own use (our pallets are made from recycled woodchip and all our printed matter is done on recycled paper and card). #wotsnottolove #wotnottribe",22-04-2018,0,,,0,136,2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh3Oe7pgMaU/,

At Wotnot we know it’s cool to be kind to our planet and we take this job very seriously. From being conscious of the waste generated in a standard office on a daily basis (always reuse first!), to creative up-cycling (our empty tape rolls end up in childcare centres and local playgroups to be used for craft), we aim to minimise environmental impact. If it can’t be re-used, we recycle and likewise we source recycled materials for our own use (our pallets are made from recycled woodchip and all our printed matter is done on recycled paper and card). #wotsnottolove #wotnottribe",28-11-2017,0,,,0,108,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/BcB-Iy1l03B/,

""Wotnot has been my favourite organic sunscreen since my kids were born. The natural oils, aloe Vera, vitamin E and Shea butter nourishes and hydrates the skin while protecting it against dangerous UV damage.  Most sunscreens are loaded with sulphates, parabens & other nasty toxins and as the skin is the body's largest organ adding these to a child's skin could prove toxic. Wotnot's ingredients are so pure they can safely be used on children with sensitive or irritated skin. This beautiful, organic sunscreen is still my go-to to protect my precious children's skin as they grow. “ - Katrina Ellis N.D. , world-renown author, naturopath, herbalist & wholistic health lecturer #wotnottribe #wotsnottolove",30-01-2017,0,,,0,239,11,https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4lzDDBvsB/,

If it can’t be re-used, we recycle and likewise we source recycled materials for our own use (our pallets are made from recycled woodchip and all our printed matter is done on recycled paper and card).

Avocado oil is one of the richest sources of beneficial monounsaturated fatty acids like oleic acid. These fats are a great addition to your diet but can also have an immediate effect on the texture and appearance of your skin.

Not only is avocado oil extremely good at hydrating and softening your skin, is it also often recommended as an effective treatment for acne and blackheads, eczema and other forms of skin inflammation, and is beneficial for diminishing age spots and smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles.  #wotsnottolove",22-07-2016,0,,,0,55,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/BILocTcBQgh/,

When founders and mothers, Sinead Roberts and Sioned Guard, launched the first environmentally friendly nappy in Australia, Moltex Oko, it fast gathered a cult following of health conscious hipsters, environmentalists and yummy mummies alike. The customers loved the quality and eco credentials of the Moltex nappy and were quick to ask for complementary all-natural products of an equally high standard. The enthusiasm for the nappy was so great that Sinead and Sioned knew they had to answer the pleas of their tribe and create more products with the same integrity. Wotnot Naturals was born to do just that and is still growing the same mission today.

Not only is avocado oil extremely good at hydrating and softening your skin, is it also often recommended as an effective treatment for acne and blackheads, eczema and other forms of skin inflammation, and is beneficial for diminishing age spots and smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles.
